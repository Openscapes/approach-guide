**Listening**

How we listen differs whether we are in mentor-mode or coach-mode:

-   When we listen as mentors, we’re trying to understand where our expertise can help someone solve a problem.

-   When we’re listening as coaches, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem, and tap into their own wisdom to find their solution, likely outside of our domain expertise.
