Some common steps to developing infrastructure for growing a Mentor Community! 


## Invite people to opt in as Mentors

We send invitation email to (re-)engage folks - this is an example sent to NMFS Openscapes Mentors Google Group in Fall 2024 to invite them to opt in for 2025.

## Invite to opt in email example

Subject: FY25 NMFS Openscapes Mentors - invitation to opt-in!

Date: November 19, 2024

Hi All!

A key part of the [Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/data-modernization-efforts-under-inflation-reduction-act) is the development and support of local leaders in Open Science, Open Data and Data Modernization. The NMFS Openscapes Mentors' cohort provides a support and leadership development group to help **you** make progress on your own, your team’s, your office’s or our line office’s Open Science, Open Data and Data Modernization goals. In 2025 we’ll be dialing up our work together as a cross-NMFS Openscapes Mentors community and invite you to continue to be involved! Please read the details below, and opt in via the [OpenscapesParticipants \[ nmfs-mentors \]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R7aibx9u2siPqnxsflL7EQ9I0FB-wJMVpZ0O-X2TRhE/edit) sheet by December 18th. Our intent is not to move anyone off the mentors list, but to reestablish your commitment and support from your supervisor. 

**Proposed activities 2025 - NMFS Openscapes Mentors**

-   The expected time commitment is 8 hours/month: Two 1.5-hour Mentor Calls per month and 4 hours of Coworking sessions. 

-   Mentor Calls biweekly beginning Jan 13, 2025 and Mentors Coworking in the intervening weeks.

-   Skillbuilding: Mentoring with a Coach Approach. 6-session Mentor Calls takeover Feb - April 2025 with Tara Robertson. See [Lowndes et al. 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11341) Ecol & Evol, [blog post](https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-05-17-mentor-coach/).

-   Opportunities to participate in Openscapes mentor activities with Open Science peers across the other Openscapes mentor groups (NASA, EPA, Fred Hutch, Pathways) held at conferences throughout the year (ESIP, AGU, Posit) and in coworking sessions.

-   Opportunities to develop ideas with the larger mentor group.

-   Voice feedback and ideas with leadership, including at Mentor retreats, and grow opportunities to help provide direction at NMFS.

-   Support the Fall 2025 NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohort according to your capacity (see [Mentor Roles](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/champions.html#mentor-roles)).

**How do I opt in?**

-   If you would like to join the FY25 NMFS Openscapes Mentor Cohort, please talk to your supervisor and confirm support for 8hrs/month of your time to participate. Then, **opt in with a Yes in the column E** dropdown in the [OpenscapesParticipants \[ nmfs-mentors \]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R7aibx9u2siPqnxsflL7EQ9I0FB-wJMVpZ0O-X2TRhE/edit) sheet! It is ok if you need to opt out of this group; we know participation will ebb and flow. To opt out, add a No in column E. We’ll take your name off the email list. 

-   **Indicate all time slots you are able to attend with Yes / No in Columns F - H**. We will select the most popular time for biweekly Mentor Calls and the second for Mentors Coworking in the intervening weeks. You can still be a part of the Mentors Community if you cannot make these synchronous times.

-   If you know someone you think would be interested, please feel free to share this message.

-   Deadline December 18.

We’ll also have one final Closing Call for 2024 NMFS Openscapes Mentors, December 11, 1 - 2:30 pm PT / 4 - 5:30 pm ET. You’re all invited!

Please reach out if you have questions!

Cheers,

Stefanie Butland, Julia Lowndes, Openscapes

## Welcome email example

Subject: Welcome to the NASA Openscapes Mentor Community!

Hi Rhys et al,

Welcome, we're excited you'll be joining the [NASA Openscapes](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/) Mentor community!

This cross-DAAC mentor community is creating & teaching resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the cloud. We learn and develop common materials and teaching approaches together, working with alignment on common needs for researchers using NASA Earthdata. We meet regularly via video and collaborate asynchronously - details follow.

We are currently gearing up for workshops and presentations at the Fall AGU Conference - will you be attending?

Here are the first few steps for onboarding to this community:

1.  **Read the [NASA Mentors Onboarding](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/contributing/onboarding.html) section** **of the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook**. There are links to further information and work by the NASA Mentors, including slides, reading, and setup for what to expect.
2.  **Provide your GitHub username** **via our [JupyterHub request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcKar-yNnofiAVKlks79AgmQeM1beLCQM5TW_0__x_JU4B3g/viewform?usp=sf_link)**.
3.  **Look out for and accept invitations** to our Calendar, Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub. Note that to access our 2i2c JupyterHub, you'll need to provide your GitHub username and accept the GitHub Teams invitation.
4.  **Carpentries Instructor Training** - We partner with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a nonprofit that teaches introductory coding skills around the world. This remote training is not coding-specific, but it is a pedagogical approach to teaching technical topics, and has grown a common teaching approach for NASA Openscapes Mentors. Please sign up following the 2-step process below.

## Intro email example

Hi V,

It was great to meet you; your colleagues said you're able to join the NASA Openscapes Mentors from PO.DAAC -- we're super excited, welcome! We're preparing for a Sept 20 kickoff to onboard new mentors, and have a light outline of plans here: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#current-activities.

This cross-DAAC mentor community is creating & teaching resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the cloud. The expected time commitment is 3 days/month per year (and this ebbs and flows with your deadlines). This accounts for \~6 hours/month of synchronous calls with the rest of the time being self-directed towards improving support approaches for specific DAACs. You'll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community. Please talk with your supervisor to make sure you are supported in alignment with your job; we will share with EOSDIS and HQ as well.

We'll soon add you to calendar invites. If you'd have time for a 1:1 intro in the next few weeks, that would be super -- we can share more and answer any questions you have ahead of our Sept 20 kickoff. The week of Sept 5 I'm available most days between 11-2pm PT if you'd have 30 minutes to chat.

Cheers, Julie

## Create a way to email Mentor group

This is evolving.

For NASA, we started off by creating a **Google Group** so we could easily add mentors to Google Folders and Calendars. This hasn't worked perfectly because not everyone can use their work address to access Google things. We collect a second email address in the ParticipantsList spreadsheet, but if we use Google Groups we need to make sure that everyone's Google-access emails are included in the Google Group. In August 2024, we created a Google Group for NMFS Openscapes Mentors.

### Settings

**Step 1:** In the Google Groups (no admin access needed), create a new Google Group

**Step 2:** Julie, as Google Workspace Administrator, must do the following. Navigating to Directory > Groups:

-   change the Group Access Type to Allow Members Outside Your Organization > yes
    -   without this setting, members are not able to search for or find the group listed in "My groups"
-   Who can join group - Invited users only > change

**Step 3:** In the Google Groups (no admin access needed): 

-   change Group Settings, Who can see group - Anyone on the web
    - Organization members (aka Openscapes team with Google Workspace access) or Julie as Administrator should set viewing privacy (screenshot) so conversations are not visible to the open internet.
- Who can see conversations - the Google Group: 

![Google Group access (in About)](images/google-group-access.png){width="60%"}

Group description: NMFS Openscapes Mentors list. Welcome! We use this Google Group primarily for calendar invites and coordinating emails to the whole group. Who can see these emails? Members of the Openscapes organization (aka the Openscapes team) and members we invite to this Group. ("who can see" added so members consider what they share).

We chose not to include an email subject prefix e.g. \[nmfs-openscapes-mentors\] since email itself is sent from the sender to the group address, and email includes footer with group information.

![Email sent to Google Group from Julia](images/google-group-email.png)

We're also using GitHub Teams more, for 2i2c access and coordinating. Rather than a Google Group that is difficult to hand off in terms of managing, a GitHub Team might be the way to go. This will raise challenges for any private info (e.g. Carpentries code), but that could be handled in Slack.

## Create a GitHub Team with Mentors

Create a GitHub Team in GitHub org Openscapes, NASA-Openscapes, or NMFS-Openscapes, that includes new and past Mentors. Team name: `nasa-mentors-community`.
