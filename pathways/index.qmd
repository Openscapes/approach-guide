title: Pathways to Open Science
---

**Pathways to Open Science** is a remote event series for Black environmental & marine researchers to build community for the future of data intensive science. 

The website is: <https://openscapes.github.io/pathways-to-open-science/>

Ileana Fenwick leads this program with intentional engagement and collaboration with Black in Marine Science ([BIMS](https://www.blackinmarinescience.org/)), Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science ([BWEEMS](https://www.bweems.org/)), and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) marine science professors.
