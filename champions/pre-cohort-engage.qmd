title: "Pre-cohort engagement"
---

## Overview

Pre-cohort engagement is focused on potential participants for the Cohort.

**We focus our engagement/recruitment of team leads** (i.e. PIs) to coordinate for their teams. This is so there is buy-in for the team to invest time into learning with the Openscapes Cohort. The Cohort will explore software and practices that help teams collaborate more efficiently, and are not only for people who code or work with data.

We begin this engagement once we've scheduled the dates, \~2 months before the Cohort begins: see the Program Design Chapter for details about timing.

Depending on the Cohort, recruitment may happen by the partners internally rather than by Openscapes. Approaches we've iterated/formalized can still help in these cases - for example having a public webpage with all information (which gives it some official "weight" and is also a single place to point folks to for details), and focusing on engaging and building trust with team leads so that their teams are approved to spend time.

## Announcement: call for nominations

Once we finalize schedules and text in the CohortPlanningDoc, we announce the opportunity as ask team leads to nominate their teams.

### Email, Mastodon, Fliers

Our partners will distribute the announcement via their channels through email, listserves, fliers, etc. We can also tweet the announcement from our account (https://fosstodon.org/\@openscapes). All announcements will link to the opportunity's post on the Openscapes events page (see next).

### Openscapes events page

We create a post on the Openscapes Events page with details about the opportunity. This can be cross-posted elsewhere. It will be linked in any email correspondance, fliers, tweets, etc. Here is an example: <https://openscapes.github.io/events/posts/2021-05-07-css-champions>

## Program overview

**This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for Fred Hutch research groups to explore open data science practices and strengthen collaboration and reproducibility.**

[**Openscapes**](https://openscapes.org) is an approach and a movement that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science [^1],[^2]. We mentor research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes' mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science[^3], enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

[**Openscapes Champions**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) is a remote-by-design mentorship program for environmental and Earth science research teams to explore open data science practices. Participants attend as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/Python, GitHub, metadata, cloud), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.

**This opportunity is funded by NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center ([NWFSC](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northwest-fisheries-science-center)).**

## Cohort details

:::

**Google Sheet:** For some cohorts, a Google Form isn't the right way to have potential participants to share their interest, particularly as team form. NOAA Fisheries partners have found it best to coordinate internally with a Google Spreadsheet, that may or may not be linked from an events page. Here is a [Template Sign-Up Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TkgQ1VNYK4MeY9WhO_OEp1AHeTqf16v7VvCWwSOD5M0/edit?usp=sharing) from SEFSC & AFSC.

## Selection and coordination

Selection and coordination varies somewhat depending on the Cohort. Academic cohorts are most often nominated by faculty PI, so first email communications are with them and then team/lab/group members are added as a second step as teams confirm, and finally we write the cohort as a whole. Government cohorts are often selected within the agency with less focus on "team lead", and so email communications are sent out to the whole cohort from the start. Below are examples of the Academic cohort process, ending with the [Cohort Welcome](#cohort-welcome) email to the whole cohort - see there for examples for welcoming government groups as well.

*We have example text for these that we will pull into a template Google Doc and link here* <!---TODO: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzSL-ZzX2VFDh1Av1_uuADiB4Jc1F5j2dM_mo3d1fyg/edit#--->

### Selection rubric

We have a selection rubric and work with partners to select participating teams. Many groups have their own internal process however, and that's great.

### Email to confirm team leads

When teams have nominated themselves, we send an email to potential team leads with more details and ask them to reply cc'ing their teams and scheduling 1:1 intro calls.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example email welcome to selected PIs

Subject: Welcome to the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉

Dear \[PI\],

Thank you for nominating your team to participate in the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort! We are excited for you to be a part of the cohort; this email is your official acceptance. To confirm you're still able to participate, please:

1.  **Book a 30-minute intro call on August 27 or 30** \[link to Google Cal booking page\] -- or suggest other times if that is not possible, preferably September 10. These are short intro calls with Openscapes and team leads to start getting to know each other, share more details about the Champions Program, learn about the team, how they work, their goals for the Cohort, and answer any questions.
2.  **Respond to this email, cc'ing your team members** (up to 4 others). We will then add you and your team to Google Calendar invites for all 4 Cohort Calls.

Our [cohort page](https://openscapes.github.io/2021-fdd/) details the dates and times, as well as some background about what to expect, Openscapes, and FDD. We will also email the full cohort prior to the Aug 29 start date.

### Email to confirm individuals

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example email welcome to selected NMFS individuals

Subject: Welcome to the NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉

Hello All,

We are so excited to welcome you to the 2022 SEFSC Openscapes Champions Cohort! Our first Cohort Call is the first week of October and we wanted to share some information with you. Many thanks to Erica Rule for coordination and support in creating this opportunity, and to Adyan Rios and Molly Stevens who are co-leading this Cohort. This is one of four [NMFS Openscapes](https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io) Cohorts happening concurrently this Fall and we’ll create some opportunities for you to connect. 

The [Openscapes Champions Program](https://openscapes.org/champions) is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the Cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our Cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate. 

**Preparing for our Cohort. This week, please**:

1.  **Check that you’ve received Google Calendar invites for our 5 Cohort Calls**. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.

    1.  **Dates:** October 4, 18, November 1, 15, 29

    2.  **Times:** 10:00am - 11:30am PT

    3.  **Location:** Remotely, via Zoom (link will be added to Calendar invites)

2.  [**Book a 30-minute intro call the week of Sept 26**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUx3MjBab3hoUGpLfGRlZmF1bHR8ZTcwNmUxNjRjMDQxMGNhMGRkZWY1OTYzN2I1YjVjNmU) – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These optional “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).

3.  **Read before our first call[Lowndes et al 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160)**: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools.

**Additional Information.**

All Openscapes events abide by our[Code of Conduct](https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct). We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this cohort more accessible to you.

Will be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know. We will also have live transcripts. 

“Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats)” and suggest you schedule them with your team now; people usually schedule these as 60-min meetings but you can make them whatever length you want. 

Optional “Coworking” sessions: times to implement what we’ve learned during Cohort Calls, where we work on our own projects at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up the time, be accountable for, and get feedback on focused work, and sometimes this involves breakout rooms and screensharing to plan and problem solve. We’ll send Google Calendar invitations after our first Cohort Call.

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.

Cheers,

Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland (Openscapes)

#### Email to decline

Declining nominees is the worst.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example email to decline nominees

Dear NAME,

Thank you for nominating your team to participate in the Openscapes Champions CS&S Cohort; we appreciate your interest in learning with us. This was our first open call and we had more interest than we expected, and have not been able to accept all of the great teams that applied. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to include you in our CS&S cohort.

We will be looking to offer more opportunities like this one as we grow Openscapes as a program, and invite you to stay tuned through our (infrequent) newsletter and via Mastodon [\@openscapes\@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@openscapes). There are also upcoming virtual opportunities at NCEAS, including through the Reproducible Research Techniques for Synthesis course in July.

Cheers,

Julie Lowndes and Erin Robinson

### Team setup and calendaring

Here's the process as the PIs confirm with their teams:

-   Add to OpenscapesParticipants \[ 2021-fdd \]
-   Add team leads and members to the Cohort Calls and optional Coworking sessions on the OpenscapesEvents Google Calendar. Use same Zoom link for both invites.
-   Reply all welcome email to team members with confirmation (example text below)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example text for Google Calendar invites

It's helpful to add "Openscapes" as the first word in title of Calendar invite to distinguish it from many other invites in people's calendars.

### Openscapes Coworking - Fred Hutch Champions Cohort

description text: We set up an hour for Coworking in between Cohort Calls; these are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Julie and Stef will be there to answer questions. Want to have your Team Seaside Chat at this time? We'll make a breakout room for you.

Our Cohort folder [Openscapes_CohortCalls \[ 2023-fred-hutch \]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i-ZZRMvEHDwQ5vJZpX_P4ycqOTwAKnyM?usp=drive_link) has a Coworking Agenda doc where we take collaborative notes.

### Follow teams on Mastodon

As we are introduced to team leads and members, we follow them on Mastodon from the Openscapes account.

### 1:1 Welcome / Intro calls

These are short intro calls with Openscapes and team leads or teams, to start getting to know each other, share more details about the Champions Program, learn about the team, how they work, their goals for the Cohort, and answer any questions. This is a way for us to get to know each other and to learn more about their team's needs. We hold these \~3 weeks before the start of the cohort.

Schedule these calls in 2 half-day blocks of time to fit different time zones. Create \~10 separate Google calendar items with 25-minute meetings, each with a unique zoom link. For each meeting, click the 3-dots \> publish \> copy link; add list of times & their links to the Welcome email, inviting individuals and team leads to select a time and invite their team members.

Note: We do not use a [Google Calendar Appointment Schedule](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/11608416) for these 1:1's because once a person books a meeting, it is not available to others. For large groups like NMFS Openscapes with 3 concurrent cohorts, we want multiple people and teams to be able to join the same welcome call.

Excerpt from welcome email:

**(Optional) Join a 25-minute welcome call Sep 24 or 25** – These optional calls are a chance for you to meet the Openscapes team and other NMFS colleagues in small groups, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. If you’d like to join an intro call, you should select one of the times listed below and add it to your calendar. If you joined with a team, invite your other team members to come at the same time!

**Welcome to Openscapes -- Fred Hutch Champions Cohort**

Hello All,

We are so excited to welcome you to the 2023 Fred Hutch Openscapes Champions Cohort! Our first Cohort Call is next week on August 29 and we wanted to share some information with you.

**Plan.**

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/) is an approach for better science for future us. Through the Champions Program we help researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct collaborative data-intensive science. Openscapes Champions is not a typical workshop --- its cohort-based remote sessions for teams introduces concepts and workflows, facilitates teams to talk about problems, then go and solve them with accountability and support. It is a remote-by-design program, launched in 2019, and this is our 20th Cohort! Our Cohort is sponsored by [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/), with Sean Kross and Monica Gerber supporting us and being a direct link between your needs and solutions at Fred Hutch.

**Before August 29, please**:

1.  **Check that you've received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links** for our 5 Cohort Calls starting August 29 as well as optional Coworking sessions in the weeks between Cohort Calls. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.

2.  **Complete your information in OpenscapesParticipants \[ 2023-fred-hutch \]** to make sure you can access the software we'll use (Google Drive and GitHub).

3.  **Read the [Openscapes Lesson Series](https://openscapes.github.io/series/) homepage** to learn more about what to expect (the purpose, outcomes, and process of our Cohort), and [**Lowndes et al 2017**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160) "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools" to see how a team transitioned shared workflows.

You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.

**Meet the Openscapes team.**

We're the team you'll see most often on the calls, along with a few guest speakers:

-   [Julie Lowndes](http://jules32.github.cio/), Openscapes 

-   [Stefanie Butland](https://stefaniebutland.netlify.app/), Openscapes

-   [Sean Kross](https://seankross.com/), Fred Hutch Data Science Lab

-   [Monica Gerber](https://www.monicagerber.com/), Fred Hutch Data Science Lab

Please let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we're looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.

Cheers,

Julie, Stefanie, Sean, Monica

## Guest teachers

We invite guest teachers to present topics during Cohort Calls, either from our existing slides or they can contribute their own on a similar topic. For example, Dr. Jessica Couture contributed a new slide deck on metadata and presented this during the [data strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/data-strategies.html) lesson. Most of our guest teachers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorarium for their time and expertise.

Subject: Invitation as guest teacher in Openscapes

Hi \[ potential guest teacher\],

How are you? I hope you've had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.

Openscapes has a few Champions cohorts we're leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here's the [cohort page](https://openscapes.github.io/2021-fdd/)).

We wanted to **invite you as a guest teacher** at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting \~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We're thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about [data strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/data-strategies.html), or the third and presenting about [coding strategies for future us](https://openscapes.github.io/series/coding-strategies.html). You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you're welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.

We're excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn't the right thing now to think about if there's another way we can involve you in the future if you'd like. We'd love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?

Cheers,

Julie and Erin

And some follow up advice to help strategize preparing:

## Example email advice to guest teacher

I'm following up on our conversation about your Data Strategies lesson for the CA Water Boards Openscapes Cohort. Here's my advice brain-dump ;-) 

The most important point is that you don't need to make up new material or create an activity. We teach these lessons from [our existing slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WJzVMg1Ps2cHG0G6D5kpnL-OCJ-wVBILMqtmzDQxEgU/). Julie taught from this deck to the previous Water Boards Cohort and I did the same for another cohort. The speaker notes have some guiding language. We try to basically say what's on the slides and we pepper them (within the time limit) with personal examples or anecdotes. 

The[Data Strategies page](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/data-strategies.html) in our Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, has a narrative that essentially follows the slides. Near the top of that page is a link to a recording of Ileana Fenwick teaching from the same slide deck. The first time I prepared to give that lesson (the only time so far), I started by watching Ileana's recording and reading the couple of papers/ blog posts in the slides. Tip: when a slide has a list of 10 tips, you don't need to say them all. You might say "this paper gives 10 tips for ... . I want to highlight 3". Then I said the tip and gave an example of how I've used it in my work. That's the way you get to make the same slide deck be relatable and allow you to share your own knowledge and experiences.

The Water Boards sessions are in Microsoft Teams. There are \~ 20 folks. When teaching, you don't share your screen - people follow along by clicking through the slide deck themselves - that means it's easier to use speaker notes if you like to do that. Anna Holder, the lead, is such a warm facilitator with a great sense of humour that shows through. She makes for a really positive teaching experience. 

Looking forward to seeing you soon,

Stef

Followup email the week before:

## Example email to guest teacher: week prior

Hi Emily and Chanté,

We're excited about your guest teaching and wanted to check in about it. We've had a good first week and two GitHub Clinics and people are excited to learn from how you both work!

I've just shared our \[draft Agenda\] for this second Cohort Call on October 1, with Emily planned for 11:45-12:20. Would you be able to share your plan by Sept 30 and we can iterate? We can work with you and iterate the discussion prompts following your slides if you'd like, and whether it would make most sense to have more of a group discussion rather than breakouts.

How does all this sound? Happy to meet to chat about it/review together if you have questions, or continue discussions by email.

Thank you!

Cheers,

Julie
