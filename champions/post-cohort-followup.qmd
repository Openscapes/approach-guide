## Example reminder email
Hi All!

We wanted to thank you all again for being a part of our SASI Openscapes Cohort this fall and appreciate all you were able to give with everything else going on. Yesterday's screenshare-and-tells and discussions were super and it's exciting to see the momentum you have going forward. We're excited to stay in touch (Slack, Twitter, etc) and will be sending out a last digest soon!

We'd appreciate your feedback in this [5-min survey] so we can improve based on feedback of what did and didn't work. Additionally, please email/slack us a snail-mail address for your team so that we can send a thank you card and stickers!

Thanks again, and we hope you all have a safe and healthy break.

Cheers,

Julie, Erin, Emma, and Lenny
