## Example reminder email
Hi All!

We wanted to thank you all again for being a part of our SASI Openscapes Cohort this fall and appreciate all you were able to give with everything else going on. Yesterday's screenshare-and-tells and discussions were super and it's exciting to see the momentum you have going forward. We're excited to stay in touch (Slack, Twitter, etc) and will be sending out a last digest soon!

We'd appreciate your feedback in this [5-min survey] so we can improve based on feedback of what did and didn't work. Additionally, please email/slack us a snail-mail address for your team so that we can send a thank you card and stickers!

Thanks again, and we hope you all have a safe and healthy break.

Cheers,

Julie, Erin, Emma, and Lenny

We love snail mail. This is a chance to send a written thank you to teams and also share physical Openscapes stickers.

## 3-Month Check-Ins

*Modeled after SGCI*

-   very limited structure on the call
-   revisit repo
-   share summaries from pathways

*Prompts originally from Gayle Hagler, EPA*

Elements to consider including:

- What were you working on/your situation that motivated you to participate?
  - Who were your team members and how did you work together on data?
- Did you see any shifts (now or forthcoming) in your personal or team’s research approaches as the result of the experience? This could include how your team interacts, new technical practices, any “ripple effects” to other projects.
