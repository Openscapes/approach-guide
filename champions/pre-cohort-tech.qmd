## Overview

Cohort tech setup involves the iterative setup of technical infrastructure for Champions Cohorts. Things described in this section begin after [Pre-cohort engagement](pre-cohort-engage.qmd) ends: after dates are set, 1:1 Intro calls are completed, and Cohort welcome email is sent. Some of this information is echoed in [Leading Cohort Calls](leading-cohort-calls.qmd).

Most things are set up in advance of the first Cohort Call, with a few things set up following the first Call (e.g. inviting folks to Slack and coworking sessions). We generate and review Agendas prior to each Cohort Call; they are not created all in advance.

In this page, we give some general information, then describe things in temporal order.

### Project management

We use the [CohortPlanning GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/Openscapes/projects/7) to manage the tasks involved in running Openscapes Champions Cohorts (since June 2022) and have created some [Issue Templates](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) with checklists. These can be used to quickly set up Issues for new Cohorts.

### `kyber` helps automate some setup

If you're comfortable following instructions in R (or want to try!), we recommend using our [`kyber` R package](https://github.com/openscapes/kyber) created by [Sean Kross](https://seankross.com/). `kyber` contains tools for setting up learning cohorts on GitHub, purpose-built for the Openscapes Champions Program. It automates creation of new GitHub repos and agendas in Google Docs for example, using information from the Cohort Registry (described below). We began using `kyber` in January 2022, starting with the 2022-afsc winter Cohort.

We'll need to do some configuration to use `kyber`, so follow the [configuration instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber/) before you need to use it.

Specific `kyber` functions will be described in more detail where relevant to specific tasks below.

### Google Workspace

In June 2022 we began moving our work to an Openscapes Google Workspace, starting with the 2022 NOAA SEFSC summer Cohort.

**Folder organization**

-   OpenscapesMain \> OpenscapesChampionsProgram \> contains materials for active and completed Cohorts, including 1-on-1's and specific Cohort Folders.
-   OpenscapesMain \> OpenscapesCohortPlanning \> contains materials for planning Cohorts, including the Cohort Registry and docs for Mentors Seaside Chats.

**Calendar**: The OpenscapesCohorts Google Calendar is used for events, like Cohort Calls and Coworking sessions. Add CohortFolder to calendar invites; we learned that folks go to Calendars to find the docs for meetings.

There are limits to the number of Guests that can be added to a calendar invite. Google does not provide information on the actual limit number. Our recommended strategy is to add \~80 Guests initially, then add additional blocks of 40 Guests on subsequent days. We learned this for Cross-Cohort Coworking sessions for 4 NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Tip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar

Sometimes we ask people add an event to their own Google Calendar without being added explicitly as a Guest. To do this, in a Calendar Event \> click the 3 dots \> Publish event \> choose Copy Link to event and share link in Slack or email saying "Click URL to add this to your Google Calendar". We have used this to let people in a Cohort know of an optional impromptu session like drop-in GitHub help, or a screenshare-and-tell for example.
:::

**Google Meet**: Breakout room functionality in Google Meet is limited (e.g. participant cannot dynamically choose a room to join; host must manually assign them). We prefer to use Zoom when possible.

**Google Spaces**: We have used Google Spaces for within-Cohort communications like Q&A and resource sharing when that is already the strongly-preferred tool for participants e.g. NOAA NMFS Fall 2022 Cohorts. After Cohort completion, the Openscapes team's support moves entirely to Slack.

## Timing and order of tasks

[Pre-cohort engagement](pre-cohort-engage.qmd) (the preceding section) ends with a reminder to participants the day before Cohort Call 1. The "Before Call 1" tasks below must be started *before* that last-minute reminder.

You might notice some redundancy among this list, the GitHub Project, and Cohort Setup Checklist below. We're capturing how we do things as our processes evolve.

### Before Call 1

-   Create GitHub repo; make it a website
-   Create Cohort Google Folder
-   Create Call 1 Agenda (`kyber`)
-   Email reminder to participants - day before (see [Pre-cohort engagement](pre-cohort-engage.qmd#day-prior))
-   Add participants to Cohort Google Folder - day before

### After Call 1

-   Draft Field Notes
-   Send Digest to participants via email in the week following the Cohort Call. Copy Digest to new GitHub Issue in Cohort repo (after Call 2, all digests are added as a GitHub Issue only)
-   Invite participants to Slack
-   Create Google Calendar invite for 4 Coworking sessions (after Calls 1-4) in OpenscapesCohorts calendar. Set Google Meet co-hosts. Add participants as guests.

### Before Call 2

-   Host Coworking session
-   Check in with Cohort Mentors
-   Create Agenda for Call 2 (`kyber`)
-   Set up GitHub Clinic (`kyber`)

### After Call 2 and subsequent Calls

-   Call Digest as GitHub Issue
-   Host Coworking session
-   Create next Agenda (`kyber`)

### Wrap up

-   Final Call Digest
-   Invite Cohort to 3-month checkin
-   Add songs to Spotify
-   Write thank you cards; send stickers
-   Blog post
-   Update Approach Guide
-   Review Digests and incorporate feedback

## Managing tasks in a GitHub Project

We monitor and manage the many tasks of cohort tech setup in a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/Openscapes/projects/7/). The issues for this project live in the [Openscapes/cohort-planning repo](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues). As we experiment, our system will evolve. Currently, issues contain checklists of tasks grouped as: Before Cohort Call 1; After Cohort Call 1; Before Cohort Call 2, etc.

These screenshots show two views of the same GitHub Project, as rows or as cards.

![](images/github-project-rows-view.png){fig-alt="GitHub Project rows view" fig-align="center" width="90%"}

![](images/github-project-cards-view.png){fig-caption="Cards view" fig-alt="GitHub Project cards view" fig-align="center" width="90%"}

Clicking on a row (top screenshot) or on a card (bottom screenshot) takes us to details of that item, and opening in a new tab (circled in red below) would bring us to the familiar GitHub Issue view.

## Cohort setup checklist {#cohort-setup-checklist}

The process of setting up a Cohort is detailed in a checklist. We've put it here near the beginning to give a picture of all the elements. These include technical setup in our Google Workspace and GitHub organization, and engagement with participants before and after Cohort Calls.

Below the checklist, we outline how and when to carry out each of the steps, and we'll refer back here to copy-paste it into a Cohort GitHub repository we'll create.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Example Cohort Setup Checklist

``` markdown

This issue is to help track the pre-cohort setup, following the [approach-guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/champions/pre-cohort-engage.html#planning-document) and focused on the engagement and tech setup after dates are set.

## Cohort Registry

Review the [Cohort Registry](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ys9KiTXXmZ_laBoCV2QWEm7AcnGSVQaXvm2xpi4XTSc/edit?usp=sharing) and update information for the new Cohort. This might be iterative as you create the GitHub repo and Google Drive folder. The Cohort Registry Google Sheet is in suggestion mode and will be used to generate the Cohort Call Agendas using `kyber`. Particularly important fields for `kyber`:

-   **cohort_name**: our convention is `year-shortname`
-   **date_start**: in DD/MM/YYYY format
-   **github_repo**: github repository URL (even if not yet created)
-   **google_drive_folder**: URL

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Historical aside

In 2021 we experimented doing this in the [openscapes/cohort-planning](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues) repository and also in the Cohort repo itself. In the cohort's repo it's one less place for Mentors to keep track of and there is the added benefit of an example issue in the repo for the GitHub Clinic.

If you prefer to make this planning issue in the openscapes/cohort-planning repo, that is great too. Here was our original details: This repo coordinates across cohorts, so it's best to "unwatch" except when you're tagged and then we tag each issue with the folks involved. We're using GitHub teams to group folks involved in each cohort and easily tag them. This way, we can all learn and coordinate across cohorts when we want to poke through the issues but aren't cluttered with emails. Two starting Issues to make:

-   "Quicklinks" Issue with links nice to have open during Cohort Calls. Example: [2022-nmfs-afsc](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/47). We pin this issue so that it shows up at the top of <https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues>
-   "Pre-cohort setup: Issue with check-boxes aligned with this approach-guide so we know what's been done. Aligning this Issue with the approach-guide is a work-in-progress. Example: [2022-nmfs-afsc](https://github.com/Openscapes/cohort-planning/issues/48)
:::

## GitHub repo

![Screenshot of checklist excerpt for GitHub repo and Cohort Google Folder tasks](images/checklist-beforeCall1-github.png){fig-alt="screenshot of checklist excerpt" width="90%"}

Create a Cohort GitHub repo within the Openscapes GitHub organization or in the NMFS Openscapes GitHub organization for NOAA NMFS Cohorts (starting Fall 2022). An example repository looks like this: <https://github.com/Openscapes/2021-noaa-nmfs> or this <https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes/2022-noaa-nwfsc-fall>. Our convention has been that the repository name is the same as the **cohort_name** from the Cohort Registry above, example: `2021-noaa-nmfs`. To start, a Cohort repo should include a README and a Code of Conduct. This can be done with `kyber`, as described below, or by hand by copy-pasting a README from another cohort (we did this for the first 8 Champions cohorts!) and [Code of Conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Openscapes/website/main/content/code-of-conduct.md) from the Openscapes website repo.

### Create repo w/ `kyber`

To use `kyber`, you'll open RStudio on your computer ([instructions](/contributing/setup.qmd)). In the RStudio console, install the `kyber` library ([instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber)) and follow the [configuration instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber/#configuration). Because `kyber` is under development, please re-install it each time. Browse the README to see what additional R packages you might need to install.

There's an example workflow provided to indicate when `kyber` can be helpful, before or after Cohort Calls.

-   To create the GitHub repository, we can copy the "[Create GitHub repo](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber/#create-github-repo)" code block and paste to run in the RStudio console. Yay, repo created! Review the README for any updates you need to make by hand like updating Quicklinks.
-   Now make it a website: Settings \> Pages \> Source: main, dir: root
-   Add co-leads/assists to GitHub repo with maintainer permission

## Add checklist to new repo

We can create a "Cohort Setup Checklist" GitHub Issue to help with our planning inside the Cohort GitHub repo that we just created above. The checklist tracks collective TODO's and has "quick links" that are nice to have handy for planning and when leading Cohort Calls (the ParticipantsList is important for making team breakout rooms!).

To accomplish this, we can copy the [Example Cohort Setup Checklist Issue](#cohort-setup-checklist). Click the "copy-to-clipboard" icon in that code block, paste it in a new GitHub issue and it will appear as a functional checklist. Manually update any links that are specific to the Cohort. Tag the planning team in the issue.

Here are examples from past Cohorts:

-   <https://github.com/Openscapes/2022-noaa-sefsc-summer/issues/1>
-   <https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2022-nasa-champions/issues/1>.

## Cohort Google Folder

-   Create a Google Folder (inside OpenscapesMain \> OpenscapesChampionsProgram) for participants with the name of the cohort in brackets, e.g. `Openscapes_CohortCalls [ 2021-noaa-nmfs ]`. The text inside brackets indicates who will have permission to access the folder. For a recent example - the first to use the Openscapes Google Workspace - see Openscapes_CohortCalls \[ 2021-noaa-sefsc-summer\].
-   Add a PathwayShare folder and the [Pathways Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SvBznl_P-nDJObGr6eZO5RauCjbdu0BcFMgRm_myvOU/edit#gid=0). We'll encourage participants to share their team's Pathways there.
-   Add co-leads/assists to Google Folder access

### Before Cohort Call 1

We will add participants' emails to this Google Folder prior to Call 1. We'll add Agendas here the days before each Cohort Call. The idea is to avoid overloading people with information - give folks access at the right time.

## Data entry

As teams form, we:

-   Update database with who is in which cohort
-   Google Folder Permission: Add all Cohort emails (note: some participants will provide a gmail address if their university or work email isn't gmail; add this address as well)

## Cohort Call Agendas

We do this in the days before each Cohort Call so that we can draw from a set curriculum but also adapt/refine based on what we hear from participants during Cohort Calls, Co-working, Slack, etc.

We recommend using our [`kyber` R package](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber) created by [Sean Kross](https://seankross.com/). `kyber` automates Agenda creation that we can then paste into Google Docs and make any further modifications. You can also do this "by hand" by copy-pasting files from other cohorts if you prefer (we did this for the first few Champions cohorts - see Historical aside below for those instructions).

### Create agendas w/ `kyber`{#agenda-kyber}

You'll do the following:

-   Generate an Agenda markdown file with kyber
-   Knit to html and copy-paste into a Google Doc in your Cohort Google Folder
-   Change fonts/etc and make any additional modifications

You do this from RStudio, within the Cohort repository (example `2022-noaa-afsc`). Make sure you pull before starting in case there are any updates you don't have locally.

Copy the ["Agendas" code block](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber/#agendas), edit Call details and paste in the console. After knitting and pasting the html in a new Google Doc, edit the formatting listed in [Julie's notes](https://github.com/Openscapes/kyber/issues/9).

Getting errors? See [troubleshooting documentation](https://github.com/Openscapes/kyber/issues/27).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Historical aside

[Blank agendas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1II5YXUK_iuV7fXelcUV49RPAXxI7fveJ?usp=sharing) are in a public Google Folder. Before each Cohort Call, we:

-   Make a copy
-   Save it in the Cohort Google Folder
-   Edit dates, times, add Google Folder links and Zoom links
-   Review and tailor for Cohort and Facilitator (including Land Acknowledgement)

We usually do this before each Cohort Call (as opposed to all at once at the beginning) as a way for us to review/prepare for each Cohort Call and so to reduce confusion for participants.
:::

## Slack

Our use of Slack is outlined in [Tooling](../approach/tooling.md#slack)

After the first Cohort Call, we:

-   Create a private Slack channel for the cohort, called \[ year-cohort-name \]
-   Invite Cohort to join Slack
    -   In Digest of Cohort Call 01 say, You'll soon receive an invitation to join Openscapes Slack. Here\'s some [information](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/tooling.html#slack) in our Approach Guide to help you get comfortable.
    -   Inside Slack \> Openscapes \> Invite people to Openscapes \> add list of email addresses. Invite as Member. Custom message (Copy this text exactly because URLs are not permitted in custom invitation message): "Please join us in Openscapes Slack. Here\'s some information in our Approach Guide to help you get comfortable (copy the url then remove the space after //): https:// openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/approach/tooling.html#slack."
        -   Custom invitation messages are limited to 560 characters and do not allow urls
        -   Sending the invite from inside Slack is preferable to creating an invitation link that gets sent in a separate email.
-   Write a welcome message in the #general channel: Hi Everyone - We have a new Champions Cohort that started today and we just added them to slack! They may say hello here too :wave: Here is their \[ cohort repo \] with a few more details.

## GitHub Clinics

GitHub Clinics should be part of the Cohort Calls. (In 2021 we experimented with having them as stand-alone events but found that in some Cohorts it was difficult for participants to make extra time outside of the Cohort Call, and it was extra scheduling for everyone.)

We recommend using our [`kyber` R package](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber) created by [Sean Kross](https://seankross.com/). `kyber` automates adding participants' GitHub usernames to the GitHub repo and creates their own file for them to play around in. You can also do this "by hand" at github.com and copy-paste files from other cohorts if you prefer (we did this for the first few Champions cohorts!).

### Prep clinic w/ `kyber`

Before the GitHub Clinic, we ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - as part of their task following Cohort Call 1.

To prepare for the Clinic, we do the following (with `kyber`):

-   Add all usernames with member privileges to a GitHub Team titled like `2022-noaa-afsc-cohort`
-   Give the Team access to the Cohort repo
-   Create each person's files

You do this from RStudio, within the Cohort repository (example `2022-noaa-afsc`). Make sure you pull before starting in case there are any updates you don't have locally.

From RStudio, follow [`kyber` Github Clinic instructions](https://openscapes.github.io/kyber/#github-clinic). You might need to install some of other R packages called by `kyber` for this.

### GitHub Clinic overview

GitHub Clinics are part of Cohort Calls, but can additionally be lead as stand-alone 1 hour events. They require at least two team members.

During the Clinic, the Tech Host will make breakout groups, either based on their actual research team or as a random breakout group, depending on whether they attend with their team. We use the Cohort's ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we also ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team.

The Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares.

Team members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.

Preparing for the GitHub Clinic involves:

-   adding participant GitHub usernames to the Cohort's repo
-   reviewing the slides

Julie recorded videos of her teaching the GitHub Clinic to enable others to teach it. These are linked in the [Openscapes Lesson Series book](https://openscapes.github.io/series/core-lessons/github/#github-clinic).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Historical aside

Some history: In 2021 we experimented having GitHub Clinics as stand-alone events between Cohort Calls 1 and 2, offering them twice as well as the recording as part of team's Seaside Chats. In 2022 we'll re-instate the GitHub Clinic into Cohort Call 2, and increase the number of Cohort Calls to 5.
