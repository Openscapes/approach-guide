We’ve found setting the date-times in advance (no doodle) streamlines scheduling and it makes this event seem more “official”. Plus, having team leads commit to the times on behalf of their whole teams creates more buy-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Scheduling date times\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe [NAME] Openscapes Champions Cohort will run from September - October 2021.

Our first Cohort Call is the first week of October and we wanted to share some information with you. Many thanks to Erica Rule for coordination and support in creating this opportunity, and to Adyan Rios and Molly Stevens who are co-leading this Cohort. This is one of four NMFS Openscapes Cohorts happening concurrently this Fall and we’ll create some opportunities for you to connect. \nThe Openscapes Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the Cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our Cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate. \nPreparing for our Cohort. This week, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites for our 5 Cohort Calls. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\n\nDates: October 4, 18, November 1, 15, 29\nTimes: 10:00am - 11:30am PT\nLocation: Remotely, via Zoom (link will be added to Calendar invites)\n\nBook a 30-minute intro call the week of Sept 26 – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These optional “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).\nRead before our first callLowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools.\n\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by ourCode of Conduct. We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this cohort more accessible to you.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know. We will also have live transcripts. \n“Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “Seaside Chats” and suggest you schedule them with your team now; people usually schedule these as 60-min meetings but you can make them whatever length you want. \nOptional “Coworking” sessions: times to implement what we’ve learned during Cohort Calls, where we work on our own projects at the same time together.

This is a way for us to get to know each other and to learn more about their team’s needs.\nWe use Google Calendar Appointment Slots or the new Appointment Schedule to schedule these 1:1’s ~1 month before the start of the cohort. (Learn about appointment slots vs (new) schedules. Note in early access preview of schedules, you can’t add additional team members to your appointment schedule so that they’re automatically added to booked appointments - must do that manually.) Create ~2 half-day blocks and invite team leads to book and invite their team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample text in the Calendar Appointment Slots:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort intro calls with Openscapes and team leads to start getting to know each other, share more details about the Champions Program, learn about the team, how they work, their goals for the Cohort, and answer any questions.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the 1:1’s, create an agenda for each call by copying Google doc: Template_Openscapes_IntroCall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample agenda for 1:1 intro calls\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenscapes Champions Cohort Intro Call\n[ Participants ]\n27 August 2021\n30 minutes\nAgenda:\n\nIntros\n\n \n\nOpenscapes Champions Cohort\n\n2 months to think about where you are and where you want to go\nFocus on open science, collaboration, data, inclusion\nGeared towards adult learning – focus on your own work\nMentorship for you and your team (up to 5 total people)\n\nDon’t need a shared project: idea is that there are common workflows across projects.\n\nWhat it’s not: a coding workshop or webinar.

Our first Cohort Call is on January 28 and we wanted to share some information with you, including how to prepare for the cohort series. Em Markowitz, Josh London, and Megsie Siple from AFSC are assisting this cohort; we are all available to answer any questions so please do not hesitate to contact us. Many thanks to Jeremy Rusin for coordination and support in creating this opportunity.\n\nDates: January 28, February 4, 11, 25 and March 11, 2022\nTimes: 12:00-1:30pm PT\nWhere: remotely, via Zoom (from the browser)\n\nPlan.\nOpenscapes is an approach for doing better science in less time. Through the Champions program we help research groups reimagine data-intensive science, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. The Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate.\nYou can learn more about past cohorts at openscapes.org/blog (including NEFSC, NWFSC, NMFS, and FDD cohorts), as well as openscapes.org/media.\nPreparing for our Cohort. This week, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 5 Cohort Calls starting Jan 28. You’ve also received invites for optional Coworking times in ~alternating weeks (described more below). If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\n[Book a 30-minute intro call on Jan 20 or 21] – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).\n\nWe’ll email again following the intro calls with more information, and ask that you read Lowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools before January 28.\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls.

Through the Champions Program we help researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct collaborative data-intensive science. Openscapes Champions is not a typical workshop — its cohort-based remote sessions for teams introduces concepts and workflows, facilitates teams to talk about problems, then go and solve them with accountability and support. It is a remote-by-design program, launched in 2019, and this is our 20th Cohort! Our Cohort is sponsored by Fred Hutch Data Science Lab, with Sean Kross and Monica Gerber supporting us and being a direct link between your needs and solutions at Fred Hutch.\nBefore August 29, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 5 Cohort Calls starting August 29 as well as optional Coworking sessions in the weeks between Cohort Calls. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\nComplete your information in OpenscapesParticipants [ 2023-fred-hutch ] to make sure you can access the software we’ll use (Google Drive and GitHub).\nRead the Openscapes Lesson Series homepage to learn more about what to expect (the purpose, outcomes, and process of our Cohort), and Lowndes et al 2017 “Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools” to see how a team transitioned shared workflows.\n\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls.

For example, Dr. Jessica Couture contributed a new slide deck on metadata and presented this during the data strategies for future us lesson. Most of our guest teachers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorarium for their time and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Invitation as guest teacher in Openscapes\nHi [ potential guest teacher],\nHow are you? I hope you’ve had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.\nOpenscapes has a few Champions cohorts we’re leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here’s the cohort page).\nWe wanted to invite you as a guest teacher at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting ~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We’re thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about data strategies for future us, or the third and presenting about coding strategies for future us. You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you’re welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.\nWe’re excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn’t the right thing now to think about if there’s another way we can involve you in the future if you’d like. We’d love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?\nCheers,\nJulie and Erin\n\n\n\nAnd some follow up advice to help strategize preparing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email advice to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m following up on our conversation about your Data Strategies lesson for the CA Water Boards Openscapes Cohort. Here’s my advice brain-dump ;-) \nThe most important point is that you don’t need to make up new material or create an activity. We teach these lessons from our existing slide deck. Julie taught from this deck to the previous Water Boards Cohort and I did the same for another cohort. The speaker notes have some guiding language. We try to basically say what’s on the slides and we pepper them (within the time limit) with personal examples or anecdotes. \nTheData Strategies page in our Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, has a narrative that essentially follows the slides. Near the top of that page is a link to a recording of Ileana Fenwick teaching from the same slide deck. The first time I prepared to give that lesson (the only time so far), I started by watching Ileana’s recording and reading the couple of papers/ blog posts in the slides. Tip: when a slide has a list of 10 tips, you don’t need to say them all. You might say “this paper gives 10 tips for … . I want to highlight 3”. Then I said the tip and gave an example of how I’ve used it in my work. That’s the way you get to make the same slide deck be relatable and allow you to share your own knowledge and experiences.\nThe Water Boards sessions are in Microsoft Teams. There are ~ 20 folks. When teaching, you don’t share your screen - people follow along by clicking through the slide deck themselves - that means it’s easier to use speaker notes if you like to do that. Anna Holder, the lead, is such a warm facilitator with a great sense of humour that shows through. She makes for a really positive teaching experience. \nLooking forward to seeing you soon,\nStef\n\n\n\nFollowup email the week before:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email to guest teacher: week prior\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Emily and Chanté,\nWe’re excited about your guest teaching and wanted to check in about it. We’ve had a good first week and two GitHub Clinics and people are excited to learn from how you both work!\nI’ve just shared our [draft Agenda] for this second Cohort Call on October 1, with Emily planned for 11:45-12:20. Would you be able to share your plan by Sept 30 and we can iterate? We can work with you and iterate the discussion prompts following your slides if you’d like, and whether it would make most sense to have more of a group discussion rather than breakouts.\nHow does all this sound? Happy to meet to chat about it/review together if you have questions, or continue discussions by email.\nThank you!\nCheers,\nJulie",

One critical and often-overlooked part of transitioning to Open is that it requires support from managers and leadership, who do not need to be Open science experts but who can imagine the return on investment and support their teams through time and resources to learn new skills and technologies, take risks, and even fail through the process. In this paper we describe our work developing the Openscapes Flywheel with NASA Earth science data centers, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. We offer three practical ways managers can support their teams and grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations: (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through, investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement. Together these lessons create kinder and more inclusive organizations that are more resilient as data volumes increase and software evolve, and dispel the hero myth of science. Engaging, empowering and amplifying efforts to support people while modernizing our workforce is the way that we will meet the world’s greatest challenges, from climate change to social justice to democracy. We can already see how working this way increases inclusion, reproducibility, and resilience within and across government, academic, and non-profit organizations, and are hopeful for what we can do together in growing this movement.",

We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by: Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community Empowering science teams through the Champions program Scaling the Champions program with DAAC Mentors\nIn Year 1 we focused on item (1) Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community through developing the DAAC Mentors program, leading the DAAC Mentors program, and community engagement within NASA and beyond. These activities and products are detailed below.\nIn Year 1 we adapted our plans for items (2,3) the Champions program to better align with timelines for NASA Earthdata in the cloud, as well as for further development in the Mentors community and investment in Cloud curriculum (e.g. Earthdata Cloud Cookbook and 2021 Cloud Hackathon). We advertised for a Champions Cohort for summer 2021 but shifted to March 2022 instead. We describe preparations for this in more detail below and the Cohort itself will be detailed in Year 2.\nAppendix 2 are slides from a 10-min presentation at the ESIP Winter meeting (January 2022) summarizing and visualizing some of these efforts.\n\n\nYear 2 Summary, 2022\nNASA Openscapes is a 3-year effort to grow a cross-DAAC Mentor community supporting Open NASA Earth Science in the Cloud. We approach this work as movement building, and developed the Openscapes Flywheel with NASA Earth science data centers, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. The Flywheel supports teams across NASA DAACs to to grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations by (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement (Robinson & Lowndes 2022). Through this work, some highlights of impact to date: (1 Engage): 7 DAACs participating (NSIDC, PO.DAAC, LP DAAC, GES DISC, ASDC, ASF, ORNL); have a JupyterHub and Notebook-Quarto-GitHub workflow for documentation and publishing; have co-created a consistent set of tutorials, teaching style, and mindset; co-led the 2021 Cloud Hackathon and 2022 Champions program; have documented our work through the Flywheel pub and Approach Guide; and given many invited talks & keynotes. (2 Empower): Mentors have led 10 Workshops: internal with DAAC staff and external with researchers; developed the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook; Reused tutorials, slides, graphics and facilitation and open practices; were more aware cross-DAAC, less recreating; from user feedback developed Cheatsheets and the earthaccess python library; wrote the Value of Hosted JupyterHubs (White paper RFI); Collaborating on Hackweeks, 2i2c cont'd access after workshops. (3 Amplify): Mentors are amplifying across-DAACs and beyond: Career advancement & bringing mindset to new places; Speaking up in other meetings (User Needs TIM, TRAIN, Cloud Playground); Connecting & consulting based on experiences - Pathfinder for 2i2c, comparing w/ SMCE; AWS; Engaging beyond (Pangeo Forge, Ladies of Landsat, pyOpenSci).\nFrom one Mentor, Cassandra Nickles (PO.DAAC):\n\nOpenscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. It enables us to work more openly with other DAACs toward our common goal of making the Earthdata ecosystem more accessible and inclusive. We've developed awesome material to help Earthdata users such asworkflow cheatsheets, a python package (earthaccess), and data recipes hosted in the cross-DAACNASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Perhaps just as important as what we've done however, are mindsets we've grown into along the way. It's okay to share imperfect works in progress. The virtual environment can be conducive to laughter and connection. Ideas are not too big or too small to share. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.",

The submission provides a recommendation for NASA to recognize easy, accessible, and inclusive cloud access as a Core Service to support the agency’s Open Source Science Initiative.\nThe following Request for Information (RFI) presents collective thoughts of the NASA Openscapes mentor community. NASA Openscapes, co-facilitated by Erin Robinson and Julia Stewart Lowndes, is a space where members from seven NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) come together to collaborate. This cross-DAAC mentor community develops resources, teaches, and listens to feedback from NASA Earthdata end users on a regular basis. NASA has provided data freely through the DAACs for decades, enabling researchers to make significant contributions to understanding our planet that would not have been possible otherwise. As Earthdata migrates to the cloud, we at the DAACs have been positioned to help facilitate data ease of access for end users within this cloud infrastructure. We are uniquely familiar with the broader challenges our data end users face as they transition their workflows to the cloud and hope to share our experiences and recommendations as NASA moves to inclusively support open science practices in the cloud framework.",

Notes from Julie:\n\nIt’s specifically about setting more deliberate meetings with your team so you’re not overwhelmed by so many one-off communications, and really getting to the root of why that feels so out of control for you, and about how to make true change in yourself outside of that New Year’s resolution model that feels so crushing and shameful when you can’t meet those this. This provides a different model that is much more profound and provides incremental change. This is about identifying the true cause of things and setting up small experiments for yourself that are actionable so you can test them and get feedback on what’s working and not so you can feel more agency and control in your day-to-day life. And in that help others too. I see so much benefit of this in my work and in my family. I want others to hear this too and think about how it can empower them as well.\n\n\n\nHedgehog concept: Jim Collins\nHedgehog concept\n\n\nAll We Can Save: Ayana Johnson & Katharine Wilkinson\nAll We Can Save Project\n\nThere is a renaissance blooming in the climate movement: leaderhip that is more characteristically feminine and more faithfully feminist, rooted in ompassion, connection, creativity, and collaboration. …To change everything, we need everyone — All We Can Save\n\n\nJohnson’s frustration with the climate movement isn’t about the current leaders doing a bad job—it’s just that we need more leaders.

Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.\n\n\n\nOrganizational architecture\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 6 – How Britain Invented, Then Ignored, Blitzkrieg.\nThis tale is about how the organizational architecture of existing entities - whether the British army, Sony, Kodak, or Xerox - cannot always support their own innovation because of the social structures they were built upon. Fascinating to think about in terms of how open science has not been embraced by scientific communities within the existing academic structure.\n\n\nDisruption can feed creativity\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 7 – Bowie, jazz, and the unplayable piano.\nThis tale is about music: how Keith Jarrett reluctantly played on a broken piano and how David Bowie and Brian Eno’s take on collaboration led to brand new sounds and ideas. I think about this for science and openness - working out of your comfort zones and mixing up how you do it and who you do it with.\n\n\nKaitlyn Thaney\nFunding research infrastructure\n\nthere’s also the fact that the current funding model has led to a perceived sense of scarcity, pushing open projects to compete rather than collaborate, to build new features instead of maintaining their work and deepening their level of service for their communities. An additional dimension to our work involves looking at the staffing and human infrastructure powering open technology development, maintenance, governance and stewardship. That volunteer labor and community engagement is often an invisible cost we gloss over in our estimations and recommendations, while also being a core pillar in this work.",

Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later).",

Following guidance from Ta7talíya Michelle Nahanee through her Nahanee Creative Territorial Acknowledgements Interactive Workshop, we omit the phrase “I would like to acknowledge” and jump right to the statements. Ideally we try to include an action so that people understand that these are more than just words. Here are some examples you can reuse or remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Land Acknowledgments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI live and work on the traditional lands of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] within Secwépemc’ulucw [she-KWE-pem-cooluc], the traditional and unceded territory of the Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] peoples. One thing I do to learn more is attend the annual Kamloopa powwow. Kukstemcw (thank you!) for joining us today.\n\nTo learn more about the land(s) you’re on: https://native-land.ca/. You can also text your zip code to this number and it will tell you the land(s) you’re on: 1-907-312-5085.\n\nI work on endangered and threatened PNW salmonids. Salmon are central to the Native Nations of the Puget Sound region and coast, the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, Skokomish, Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakama Nations. I see the foresight of the leaders of the Pacific Northwest Native Nations who wrote in clauses to ensure perpetual access to their ancestral fishing locations in the treaties of the mid-1800s. I acknowledge the determination of the next generations who protested on the water and in the courts to force these treaties to be upheld. Now, I work to educate myself on this history and specifically on the Boldt Decision and its aftermath. As a federal employee, I am part of the system that upholds these treaties and court decisions. I am aware that I am not knowledgeable as I want to be and I want to work on this.\nI am grateful I am for the land where I am here in Santa Barbara California and I want to honor the Chumash peoples who have been and continue to be stewards of the lands and waters here.\n\nLand Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/. I’ve learned more about Indigenous sense of place through Robin Wall Kimmerer’s beautiful book Braiding Sweetgrass - Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.\n\nI acknowledge that the Piscataway Indian Nation continues to maintain a relationship with the lands where I am here in Potomac, MD. The Piscataway Indian Nation received recognition by the State of Maryland in 2012. I acknowledge their long-standing kinship with these lands and waters. To make this statement more meaningful, I invite you to learn more about land acknowledgement statements via https://native-land.ca/ and other resources and to reconsider in what ways you can improve your relationship with the lands and waters you steward.\nI have lived and worked for more than 20 years on lands that are not mine, but those of the Narragansett. The Narragansetts are the namesakes for the town of Narragansett and of Narragansett Bay and they are the traditional caretakers of marine and fresh waters as well as the land that currently makes up most of the state of Rhode Island. To learn more about the Narragansetts and other native peoples of this land visit the Tomaquag Muesuem or consider their virtual programs. Land Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/.\nI am grateful for the land where I am here in St. Petersburg Florida, and I want to honor the Seminole, Miccosukee, and Tocobaga people who took stewardship of this land and surrounding waters. I acknowledge the painful history of genocide and forced removal from their territory, and I respect and honor the diverse Indigenous people still connected to this land.\nThe territory that we now know as South Florida has been the traditional homelands of the Native nations including the Tequesta, the Calusa, and today the sovereign homelands of the Seminole and Miccosukee. I acknowledge that where I live, work, and recreate is located on the ancestral homelands of sovereign Native nations. I reflect on this and pay respects by learning more about ways to support our local Indigenous communities in efforts to preserve Seminole and Miccosukee cultures.",

    "text": "About This Guide\nWe’ve been growing Openscapes since founding it in 2018. This is our attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others as we grow. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that you can also use the guide to use the Openscapes Approach on your own. We encourage anyone to use and “fork” it to make it your own (particularly as it’s a bit more developed!).\nWe complete a full revolution of our Flywheel (see Robinson & Lowndes 2022) each time we lead the Champions Program.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 from Robinson & Lowndes 2022. The Openscapes Flywheel builds momentum as a culture change engine as We engage a Future Us mindset through welcoming and creating space and place, we Empower a learning culture by investing in learning and trust, and working openly, and we amplify open leaders by leveraging common open data science workflows, skills and tools and inspire broader scientific culture change. And the Flywheel turns again.\n\n\nEach turn of the flywheel delivers the Champions program for a Cohort of research teams so that they can begin transforming their workflows towards kinder, inclusive open science and inspire their broader communities. We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, by investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn new software and inclusive practices and to meet specific Cohort needs, and by attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork to welcome more folks to the open science movement.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus on Champions Program and then the Mentors Framework.\n\nThe Flywheel is a concept developed by Jim Collins in the book Good to Great; it’s the idea that when building something to last, there is no single defining action. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond. We’ve found these are the synergistic and overlapping elements for open data science movement building which we’ve tested, iterated, and refined in working with over 150 research teams since 2019. We are really focused on building habits that last, and institutional change that lasts.\n\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe’re collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto. Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, which we use to openly develop and publish all Openscapes websites, books, and blogs. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered natively using Jupyter and Knitr engines. We are gradually converting to build all our materials with Quarto.",

    "text": "Slack\nAre you inviting someone to join Openscapes Slack? Send them the link to this section.\nHave you received an invitation to join Openscapes Slack? Here’s some information to help you get comfortable.\nOpenscapes uses the free Slack plan. This means we can all see message history for the previous 90 days.\nHow do I use it? Slack can feel like a daunting new tool, especially when we’re introducing lots of new tools during Champions Cohorts. There are both technical and etiquette aspects to getting comfortable. For technical tips see Getting started for new members and How to use Slack. This Slack quick start guide Woodley and Pratt (2020) from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement includes 1) configuring your account; 2) channels and notifications; 3) communicating.\nAbout Openscapes Slack: We use Slack as a way to build community by hosting a space for people to connect with each other around Openscapes-relevant topics. We want it to be a supportive, trust-based community of folks doing data intensive science. Members include, but are not limited to, people who have participated in a Champions Program, NASA Openscapes Framework, Pathways to Open Science, Reflections, NASA Cloud Cookbook Hackdays, or other Openscapes programs. Current Slack members can invite others to join - an informal sponsorship approach.\nWhen you join, you’ll automatically land in several channels: #welcome, #cool-finds, #events, #general, #random, #seaside-chats, #shared-joy 🌈. You can browse other channels and choose to join them. People are invariably friendly and open to asking and answering questions. You can get a feel for how things work by “listening” to the discussions, then jump right in!\nIf you’re part of a cohort for an Openscapes program you’ll also be invited to a private cohort channel. Open isn’t all or nothing; being open with this cohort you’re getting to know is a good way to start getting comfortable with the Slack community more broadly.\nThe #welcome channel is a place for new members to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to help them feel welcome by adding an emoji or saying “I work on sea turtles too!”. Here’s a short read on The Value of #Welcome.\n\nChannel definitions\nThese definitions are meant to help people know where to post or ask questions. They are listed in the Slack channel Topic and Description (because the Topic preview is easily visible in the channel, while the Description, not so much).\nWhen people join, they automatically land in #welcome #general #seaside-chats #events #cool-finds #shared-joy #random.\n#welcome: A place for people new to our community to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to make them feel welcome; the default channel that members cannot leave if they leave all other channels\n#general: Openscapes team posts Openscapes announcements\n#seaside-chats: A place to discuss ongoing progress. Friendly Q & A about good enough practices, team culture, tools …\n#events: Events that might be of interest to others in our community. Openscapes events go in #general\n#cool-finds: Posts, datasets, podcasts, repos, papers, videos, packages, …things you found that are cool\n#jobs: Job opportunities, seeking work, offers to connect people with those “on the inside”\n#shared-joy: Sharing joy of any shape or size\n#random: Non-work banter and water cooler conversation\nteam-openscapes: (private) ~daily checkins. We started this when our team grew in 2024 so that Stef and I weren’t in DMs anymore. Like we did during mentor-coaching, we check in here daily when we’re working on Openscapes stuff to say hi and give a heads up about what we’re working on. For Stef, Andy, and me this is almost daily, for Liz it’s less so and when it’s makes sense for her, since she’s less time. We tag people when they’re needed directly so if it’s better for you to not be notified until you’re tagged that is great too.\n\n\nSet Slack reminders\nHere’s an example of how to set a Slackbot reminder for recurring meetings, in this case, biweekly. Add links to “zoom link” and “notes”.\n/remind #earthaccess “Our earthaccess hack starts in 1 hour! Here is the meeting zoom link and the notes” at 9AM every other Tuesday\nHere’s how it appears in Slack:\n“Reminder: Our earthaccess hack starts in 1 hour! Here is the meeting zoom link and the notes”\n\n\nSlack integration with GitHub\nWe’d love for most resource sharing and conversations to happen in the open and in a more persistent location than Slack. Places like GitHub Discussions are great for this. Thanks to Matt Fisher for getting us started with Slack notifications for GitHub Discussions.\nWe can subscribe Slack channels by repository and event types we’re interested in. In Slack, we can run /github help to get some more info on the command to modify subscriptions. Full documentation.\n\nExample\nThe Slack #nasa-mentors channel is set to get notified of new and answered discussions for just the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook GitHub repo. The subscription process was started with this command:\n/github subscribe NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook discussions\nThe above will subscribe to “discussions” in addition to undesirable default notifications. We can unsubscribe from the defaults to quiet it down with another comment:\n/github unsubscribe NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook issues pulls commits releases deployments",

For our lesson materials, like Champions Cohorts, this provides a robust way for people to add their participation to their CV as professional development. We use the Zenodo repository and a Zenodo Openscapes Community for this purpose.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo. GitHub itself is not a repository. For the full picture, this 1-hr webinar is helpful: Zenodo: open digital repository | 2022.12.07.\nWe created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a “semantically meaningful group” of research products using these example Zenodo Communities as inspiration: NASA’s Transform to Open Science; Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE).\nZenodo has a Sandbox in which one can create and refine a draft Community before creating the real thing. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear. Creating a Sandbox first forces you to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than a personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nAnyone can request to have their Zenodo record listed in the Zenodo Openscapes Community. Curator is Stefanie Butland via curator@openscapes.org. We don’t want to include everything; too big and its value diminishes. We do curate:\n\nResources on GitHub like the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, Pathways to Open Science\n\nmake a “release” on GitHub and submit that to Zenodo, choose type = other, or lesson. See instructions in Documentation.\n\nkey blog posts like ESIP 2022, 2023 panels\n\ncreate and upload pdf of post from the website, choose type = other\n\nslide decks from key presentations\n\nupload pdf of slides, choose type = presentation\n\n\nWe do not curate datasets.\n\n\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nIf you own an existing Zenodo record you’d like to have listed, log into Zenodo, go to that record’s page, click yellow Edit button (top right) …\n\nIn the Edit page that appears, scroll to Communities section &gt; type “openscapes” and select it …\n\nClick Save &gt; click Publish (these appear at top and bottom of the edit page)\n\ncurator@openscapes.org will get email notification of your request and accept, or may ask for further information.\n\n\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nVideo tutorial from OpenAIRE_eu (4.5 min)\n\nFor a blog post or presentation, save as pdf, filename: openscapes_post_name_year.pdf or slides_name_year.pdf, example: openscapes_post_noaa_afsc_2022.pdf\nLogin to Zenodo (login via GitHub is convenient), go to https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=openscapes and upload your pdf (files &gt; start upload).

This is a pretty great bonus.\nWe keep a list of Openscapes authors ORCID IDs in OpenscapesParticipantsMainList Google sheet, Mentors tab\n\nDescription: for an Openscapes blog post, use the italicized preface; for a presentation, use the abstract. End with “Link to source blog post: URL”\nVersion (optional): We’ve settled on using CalVer: YYYY.0M (zero-padded month) since Luis López said “I like CalVer for books and environments” when we asked for advice. It’s a bit redundant with publication date.\nKeywords: To promote findability and consistency, we suggest using some of these keywords, based on those used by related records. Wow, keywords appear to be case sensitive. Search keywords:“Open Science” gives 1770 records; keywords:“open science” gives 1395 records; keywords:“open science” OR “Open Science” gives 11112 results (not sure why those don’t add up) (May 23, 2023)\n\nOpenscapes\nOpen Science\nNASA\nNOAA\nJupyterHub\ncloud computing\nconference name e.g. ESIP, AGU, SORTEE, FORCE11\nOpen Educational Resources (for lesson series)\n\n\nLicense: Open Access, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nFor GitHub releases that include code and documentation, we include a LICENSE.md file on GitHub, then on Zenodo we select Licence: Other (Attribution).\n\nFunding: Would be great to add this, but we’ve not established guidelines yet\nPublish!

Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture, perspective, or background\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nIf you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back, encourage other voices to join in, and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ perspectives, contributions, and needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo.

    "text": "Blogs\nWe write a lot of blog posts. They give visibility to things that are otherwise hidden. One example is writing a blog post for a workshop on Audience Building and Strategic Planning. This was a lot of work to put together, and we think it’s valuable for others! In addition to posting the slides, how could we amplify it more and tell a story around those slides that make it more sharable? That’s right, a blog post.\nBlog posts take time. A lot of time. And they often feel extra, especially in a culture of needing peer-reviewed publications. But they are super valuable, and important. So, here are some strategies we use to write blogs:\n\nReuse structure. Copy-paste a previous blog post structure. Ah, yes, we have the publish date, the title, the authors up top, some italics introducing what this is and who the authors are, with quick links. Then, 3-4 headers with up to 3 paragraphs each and a few pictures. Delete the content but start from there.\nReuse content. We spend a lot of time planning events and slides - reuse them! Copy text directly from the Agenda docs, and from the slides! Add text to shape the story, but then copy-paste as much as possible. This can be harder with posts that synthesize events (like the 2022 ESIP blog post and upcoming post for 2023). These events require more time to rewatch the recording and synthesize and identify themes, but there is still a lot to be reused, especially quotes!\nShare with co-authors early. But not too early. Often we are trying to do the legwork to get a blog post structured and drafted describing the work they’ve already put into the event or slides. So along with the next point, do this until it’s good enough, and share!\nBe ok with imperfect, and done! Yes, there is more to say if you put months of time into this. And we may find a sentence to be polished after posting, and that’s ok. We aim to share ideas and momentum from our community with the mindset that sharing some and imperfectly is better than silence.",

    "section": "About Qualitative Research",
    "text": "About Qualitative Research\n\nWhat is Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)?\nQualitative Data Analysis (QDA) or qualitative coding is a method of analyzing textual data. Textual data can be drawn from interview or focus group transcripts, observational notes, newspapers, blog posts, social media posts, books, texts and really anything related to the topic. These methods are commonly used in social science fields such as sociology, anthropology, political science, business, education, user experience design and more.\nWhile methods of doing qualitative analysis can vary depending on field and methodological background, the common denominator is that this form of research does what is called “qualitative coding” or qualitative data analysis. Sometimes folks use a computer to do QDA using software such as Taguette, NVivo, Dedoose, Atlas.TI or MaxQDA to name a few.\nFor those who have less experience in social science fields, the terminology of “coding” can be misleading because one might assume we are using the word coding in terms of writing code for analysis. However, this is not how qualitative researchers use the term coding.\nFor scientists, it can help to replace the word “coding” with a word like “annotating” or “tagging” because these terms are more descriptive about what it is that the researcher does in qualitative coding. While there are variations, the typical QDA process is for the researcher or research team to read through the qualitative materials and to develop codes to answer the research questions based on both 1) the patterns seen in the data itself and 2) theoretical and substantive knowledge of the field.\nTo do this, qualitative researchers often start with either existing research, metrics or previous qualitative codebooks to build their understanding of what the data might say and what they should look for.\nResearchers will then go through the data and code (or tag/annotate) selections of the text to summarize a theme or an idea found in the data. This can be as simple as taking short responses to a survey and annotating them with descriptive codes or as complex as using codes to tag quotes from hours long interviews or focus groups.\n\n\nA Note about Qualitative Research\nThere are a few differences in qualitative research that may not be apparent to those who are learning about how to do this work for the first time.\nFirst, In qualitative social science research, we are often using inductive rather than deductive research. In typical scientific research, there is an existing hypothesis and the research design is to test that hypothesis. By contrast, qualitative research may have a general research question that will evolve over the course of the research and inductively be explored. Meaning that we know that there is something here to study, but we aren’t always certain what it is that we’re looking at.\nA good analogy would be if we were a biologist going to a fictional planet to study the life that exists on that planet. We might already have categories of “tree” or “grass” or “bush” from our understanding of plant life on earth and we could use those to begin our work of categorizing what we see on a different planet. That said, we would be aware that these terms might be limited as we are looking at plant life we’ve never seen before. As we learn more about the environment, our categories to understand what we are looking at would evolve. Our research question would also likely evolve as we begin to find patterns and understand the ecosystem. In the same way, as we do qualitative research we are often creating systems to help us understand what we’re seeing/hearing and we’re adapting our research to integrate what we’re learning as we do it. This is how our research can be inductive.\nSecond, the motive and output of qualitative research can be quite distinct from quantitative studies. While it is possible to confirm or refute a hypothesis in qualitative research, it’s not as common as other forms of research output. For instance, qualitative research outputs could be: narratives, explanations of a process or an activity, a list of reasons why people did something, relevant language usage and terms that are unfamiliar. Our analysis might also give us a better understanding of the topic in order to do more research (of any kind), or to write a better research question. It might also be useful for developing relevant hypotheses to do more work on this topic area.\nThis work with Openscapes I would consider to be applied or practical research designed to support the aims of the organization. However when that is not true, such as when a qualitative study is being developed in the academy, the end result can also be to add to theory about a particular topic.",

    "text": "QDA for Openscapes\n\nHow we used QDA for Openscapes\nOur research question was “How does Openscapes support teams to transition from closed research practices to open research practices?” We then picked a cohort and decided to use the open agendas from that cohort to develop a codebook. We wanted to get a better sense of how they talked about open research in the agenda that we were looking at. Our hope was that the agendas would be a sort of “living document” that gave us insights into what the discussion was and how participants made meaning of the learning they were gaining in open research.\n\n\nHow we created the Qualitative Codebook for Openscapes Agendas\nInitially we began with the Theory of Change as a way to develop our system of codes/tags (or codebook). But we quickly realized that the categories from the Theory of Change didn’t map well onto the agendas. We changed to work from the Moore Foundation grant goals as a starting place, then when we began to see patterns in the data, we expanded from those goals and added more codes/tags to respond to what we saw in the data.\nThe final research paper reviewed the Moore Foundation goals, the way they showed up in the agendas as well as exploring the inductive topics that came up through the agendas. You can read the final report to see concrete examples.\nThe Openscapes leadership started by coding together and began to notice what worked and what didn’t in coding the agendas. As we went on, we began to add in some codes that we saw as we went through the data.\n\n\nQualitative Codebook\nHere is the codebook that we developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAdoptProtocol.io\nDiscussion of adopting protocols.io (Moore Goal)\n\n\nBuildCommunity\nDiscussion of building community across teams - broader sense of community beyond this group.

    "text": "Working with this QDA in Openscapes Going Forward\n\nDebriefs Following Calls as Data\nOne helpful way to do qualitative research in a collaborative setting is to use debrief calls after the main call is over to write down some of the key important aspects of the call. This allows it to be much easier to do the coding.\nThe team might ask themselves:\n\nWhat were the biggest topics of conversation in the call? What did people want to talk about?\nWhat kinds of questions were participants asking about?\nWhat challenge were they having?\nWhat were some of the wins that they talked about?\n\nThese notes should be added to the text that the team would use for analysis as a kind of “field note” of what the facilitators knew from the room.\nAdditionally, the debrief calls could also be a place where items in the document can be coded with multiple people looking at the document. Each person might take 3-4 codes and go through the document tagging them when they see them in the document. This would enable the coding process to be much less laborious. When there are issues or challenges, the team can talk about them, and consider adding or using certain codes when there are questions.\n\n\nHow to use Taguette\nI recommend that the Openscapes team use Taguette for doing qualitative coding as it is a FLOSS tool that is openly available and capable of collaboration among a group of people. There is documentation at this link for how to get started with Taguette: https://www.taguette.org/getting-started.html\nOver time, the research team may wish to do more complex QDA analyses with the data, however, I encourage the team to focus on the basics of the research instead of getting bogged down with the software. Taguette is a simple program but it does the basics well.\n\n\nUsing the Research\nAfter the cohort is finished and the agendas have been coded, the process of analysis of the research can begin. I encourage the team to consider conducting a synthesis meeting after the coding/tagging has been completed to go through each of the codes and to see what can be learned from each.\nFor instance, to consider over time how the challenges that the agendas shared, or the questions that participants asked can offer some insight into the way that teaching these topics could be done in the future.\n\n\nHow to update the Codebook\nWe can make changes to the codebook and should do so as the research continues. There are a few ways to consider making updates:\nFirst is to consider adding new codes to the codebook: When someone on the research team sees a topic of conversation in the agendas that seems to be a pattern (e.g. they see it in more than three places) and it is helpful to understand something about the research question, it’s a great idea to add a new code to the codebook.\nThe key question to ask before adding a new code/tag is to ask: “Does this code help us answer our research question?” If it does, it should be added. If it’s interesting but not a part of the research question, consider not including it. When adding a code, try to ensure that the one word code/tag makes sense on its own and that there is a written explanation of the definition of that code/tag.\nSecond, the research team may find themselves refining the codes and the explanations. As time goes on, the research team will develop a sense for the differences between codes, when to apply them and when not to. Part of the work is to make sure that the descriptions are clear for the team that is doing the coding and that it can be communicated to researchers in the future.\nThat said, I encourage the team to be careful of not complexifying the coding/tagging system too much. It’s a common mistake among beginner qualitative researchers to code EVERYTHING and to make a monstrous codebook with every small bit of data. Not everything needs to be coded. Be sure to refer back to “Is this going to help us understand the research question more effectively? When doing any editing.",

The author, a researcher in positive psychology and diversity and inclusion, argues that to bring advocates and critics of diversity together, leaders must orient around a broader goal: creating the conditions for all workers to flourish. Given the high rates of disengagement and burnout, especially for those in historically marginalized groups, companies need a new approach. The author argues for fostering four freedoms at work: the freedom to be, the freedom to become, the freedom to fade, and the freedom to fail. Currently the four are unevenly distributed, but interventions such as encouraging individual allyship, implementing strengths-based development programs, and enabling flexible work can make organizations safer and more welcoming for all.”",

    "text": "10-week Mentors Cohort!\nThis was co-developed with Eli Holmes, NOAA Fisheries for the 2023 Mentors Community.\nThrough facilitation and practical training for mentoring, teaching, and coaching, Openscapes will help mentors strengthen skills and strategies to support colleagues with diverse comfort levels with software, coding, and data, while also strengthening relationships across centers/offices. Through this, mentors will identify and co-create on common resources and activities – such as code or databases for identical tasks or community developed standard practices – so there is less reinventing at each center.\nThe FY24 mentor cohort will start with a mentors-only Openscapes cohort (facilated bi-weekly group meetings) during which Openscapes will guide the mentor cohort in discussing the needs and challenges for adoption of Open Science in NMFS and to develop actions to take. The facilitated meetings are virtual and twice monthly. Mentors will also collaborate asynchronously (e.g. Google Chat, GitHub). During the fall session, mentors will learn and practice coaching and mentoring skills in preparation for the winter Champions cohorts. We will also start identifying cross-center roadblocks that mentors can collaborate on throughout the next years.\n\nTimeline & topics\n\nDates: Twice monthly starting October 17, 2023\nTimes: 12:00 - 1:30pm PT / 3:00 - 4:30 pm ET\nLocation: Remotely, via Google Meet\n\n\n\nMentor Calls\nMentor Calls are when we convene as a group to learn and plan. Agendas A public copy of our Agendas is available for reuse and remixing; an original is used during the calls as an archive of our live notetaking.\n\n\n\nDate\nMentor Call Topics\n\n\n\n\n10/17\n1. Openscapes mindset for mentors: What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at our org mean?\n\n\n10/31\n2. Developing strong Open and Collaborative Communities\n\n\n11/14\n3.

We’re preparing for a Sept 20 kickoff to onboard new mentors, and have a light outline of plans here: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#current-activities.\nThis cross-DAAC mentor community is creating & teaching resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the cloud. The expected time commitment is 3 days/month per year (and this ebbs and flows with your deadlines). This accounts for ~6 hours/month of synchronous calls with the rest of the time being self-directed towards improving support approaches for specific DAACs. You’ll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community. Please talk with your supervisor to make sure you are supported in alignment with your job; we will share with EOSDIS and HQ as well.\nWe’ll soon add you to calendar invites. If you’d have time for a 1:1 intro in the next few weeks, that would be super – we can share more and answer any questions you have ahead of our Sept 20 kickoff. The week of Sept 5 I’m available most days between 11-2pm PT if you’d have 30 minutes to chat.\nCheers, Julie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowup email example\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the NASA Openscapes Mentor Community!\nHi Sean, Alicia, Guoqing,\nIt was great to meet you and we’re really excited Guoqing will be joining the NASA Openscapes Mentor community from OBDAAC!

This remote training is not coding-specific, but it is a pedagogical approach to teaching technical topics. If you would like to sign up, please follow the 2-step process below. Our membership renews Sept 14; if you have trouble signing up using our code please let me know and I can help get it sorted.\n\nRegister for the event of your choice on our Instructor Training event calendar with the code: OUR-CODE-HERE. New events are added to this calendar in December, March, June, and September.\nComplete Carpentries profile-creation form using the same code. Please note: Registration secures their seat; profile creation enables us to record their attendance and track their progress toward certification.\n\nWe’re really looking forward to working with you! Cheers, Julie",

    "text": "Create a way to email Mentor group\nThis is evolving.\nFor NASA, we started off by creating a Google Group so we could easily add mentors to Google Folders and Calendars. This hasn’t worked perfectly because not everyone can use their work address to access Google things. We collect a second email address in the ParticipantsList spreadsheet, but if we use Google Groups we need to make sure that everyone’s Google-access emails are included in the Google Group. In August 2024, we created a Google Group for NMFS Openscapes Mentors.\n\nSettings\nAfter we create a new Google Group, Julie, as Google Workspace Administrator, must:\n\nchange the Group Access Type to Allow Members Outside Your Organization.\nchange Group Settings, Who can see group - Anyone on the web\n\nwithout this setting, members are not able to search for or find the group listed in “My groups”\n\nWho can join group - Invited users only\n\nOrganization members (aka Openscapes team with Google Workspace access) or Julie as Administrator should set viewing privacy (screenshot) so conversations are not visible to the open internet.\n\n\n\nGoogle Group content visibility (in Group Settings)\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Group access (in About)\n\n\nGroup description: NMFS Openscapes Mentors list. Welcome! We use this Google Group primarily for calendar invites and coordinating emails to the whole group. Who can see these emails? Members of the Openscapes organization (aka the Openscapes team) and members we invite to this Group. (“who can see” added so members consider what they share).\nWe chose not to include an email subject prefix e.g. [nmfs-openscapes-mentors] since email itself is sent from the sender to the group address, and email includes footer with group information.\n\n\n\nEmail sent to Google Group from Julia\n\n\nWe’re also using GitHub Teams more, for 2i2c access and coordinating. Rather than a Google Group that is difficult to hand off in terms of managing, a GitHub Team might be the way to go. This will raise challenges for any private info (e.g. Carpentries code), but that could be handled in Slack.",

    "text": "10-week Cohort Skills\nIn fall 2023, we had five Mentor Calls as a full community over 10-weeks (alternating with coworking sessions). Here we detail the skills and practices Mentors experienced and experimented with in each Call.\n\nCall 1 Openscapes mindset for mentors\nWhat does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at our org mean?\n\nSpeaking up/sharing about yourself for 4 minutes - a challenge for some to take up that space, a challenge for others to limit to that space.\nKeeping on time - as a speaker and as a timekeeper\nListening: giving space/silence. Not jumping in - get comfortable with discomfort\nLive contributing to collaborative google doc - hear from more voices than we could only out loud, both time-wise and due to power structures\nLearned emoji shortcut - not frivolous; a way to connect, side conversations and encouragement to build relationships\nSaw us adjusting time on the fly in the doc and verbally - open facilitation\n\n\nYour tasks before next Call\n\nSeaside Chat: Organize 1 hour with mentors at your center/office (or other people from other centers/offices), to discuss how you could improve workflows with open science in your own work, your own center, or more broadly. You could also discuss these readings \nReadings: Read Shifting institutional culture to develop climate solutions with Open Science (2023 preprint) and How coaching skills have made us better open data science mentors (May 2023), both coauthored by NMFS Mentors, (and &lt;20 mins combined). \n(optional) Attend Coworking. We’ll send a recurring calendar invite for the weeks between Mentors Calls, Tuesdays, 12:30 - 1:30 pm PT. (find your local time). On Oct 24, Eli Holmes will report on PARR and the new 2022 memo and changes to our data workflows that are being proposed, and discuss how these changes will impact staff. (Eli is the NMFS Public Access of Research Results (PARR) representative on the NOAA PARR working group.)\n\n\n\n\nCall 2 Developing strong open and collaborative Communities\nWhat skills can we develop to support each other? What are the elements of successful open communities? What NOAA & NMFS open science communities do we like to participate in?\n\nActive listening and asking powerful questions - coaching to empower people to find their own solutions rather than suggesting our ideas of what they should do\nVulnerability, yes! Shame, no - learning and building trust by getting curious with each other\nLeveraging the experiences of a community - mentors presenting\nYou don’t have to be an expert to teach - mentors screensharing an efficiency tip she just learned\nSharing open resources for reuse - slides for 12-minute, 5-minute, or 1-slide only presentations\nCrowdsourcing resources - a list of NOAA & NMFS communities we recommend\nMaking time for live clarification - open facilitation ’til we all know the plan\nBringing attention to or sharing gratitude for a colleague - coaching kudos and examples of raising people up\n\n\nYour tasks before next Call\n\nSeaside Chat: Organize 1 hour with mentors at your center/office (or other people from other centers/offices), to discuss how you could improve workflows with open science in your own work, your own center, or more broadly. You could also discuss these readings\n\nContinue to add to ‘seeking mentors for Seaside Chat’ in the ‘Fall 2023 Openscapes mentors cohort’ sheet\nShare your Seaside Chat report outs in our doc\n\nReadings: Read 19 reasons why technologists don’t want to work at your government agency, Ben Balter\nOptional themed seaside chat. In between the full cohort calls, Eli will hold optional Seaside Chats open to any mentors. We’ll discuss Open Data and Open Science issues affecting NOAA Fisheries. Wed, Nov 8, Eli will give a brief update on what is happening at the NOAA level re Open Science. We’ve sent calendar invites.\n\n\n\n\nCall 3 Experiential learning\nWe converged on open science challenges topics and people who want to work together and we learned about and practiced experiential learning.\n\nPitching ideas - to connect with colleagues\nListening - listening to understand, avoiding solutioneering\nAsking powerful questions - often begin with “what”, “what else?”, never yes/no\nBreaking down activities into teaching concepts - identifying and letting go of extra topics\nDo - Reflect - Apply - approach to teaching\nTime constraints - how constraints both for planning time and teaching time can help determine scope of an activity\n\n\nYour tasks before next Call\n\nSeaside Chat: Have and report-out from your small-group Seaside Chats, building from topics in the Fall 2023 Openscapes mentors sheet\n\nWhat help do you need to arrange these?\nShare your meeting time so others can join. Options: post to our Google Space, Mentors Calendar, or add to column H in the Fall 2023 Openscapes mentors sheet.\nShare your Seaside Chat report outs in the SeasideChats_ReportOuts [ nmfs-openscapes-mentors ] doc.\n\nOpen Science News: Share your Open Science news in the Open Science/Open Data Weekly Updates doc\nReadings: Tips and Tools for Gentle R Introductions (slides, by Allison Horst)\nOptional themed seaside chat - Nov 20, 1-2pm PT. In between the full cohort calls, we will hold optional themed Seaside Chats open to any mentors. Mon, Nov 20 1-2pm PT, Julie and Eli will give an overview of the Openscapes Champions Program, our goals for the Feb-Mar 2024 NMFS Champions Cohorts and how this fits into the broader plan for NMFS Open Science.\n\n\n\n\nCall 4 Supporting teams to tackle workflow change through the Champions Program\nWe followed up on making connections through topic-based Seaside Chats, practiced skills for presenting and iterating new-to-us material to different audiences.\n\nCalendaring - adding a shared group to a Google Calendar invite\nPitching to different audiences - how to reframe messaging and reuse slides to communicate\nSharing imperfect work - share early to co-design with feedback\nRapid prototyping - incorporating feedback live from 1st time, to present minutes later for 2nd time\nPresenting someone else’s slides - how to let go of how you might have made the slides – and iterate them to make them work more for you\nPresenting with little prep time - saying things out loud as a way to test and iterate\nAsking questions and giving feedback - shaping Champions program comms/engagement together. Balancing keeping what works, improvement, and time.\nFeedback framework - elicit more helpful feedback using explicit guides, from The Carpentries Instructor Training:\n\nContent\n\nPositive\nConstructive\n\nDelivery\n\nPositive\nConstructive\n\n\n\n\nYour tasks before next Call\n\nSeaside Chat: join or host a topic-based Seaside Chat \n\nYou can find and add Seaside Chats on the NMFS Openscapes Mentors Calendar and post to our Google Space\nReport out in SeasideChats_ReportOuts [ nmfs-openscapes-mentors ]\nContinue to add to “seeking mentors for Seaside Chat” (Fall 2023 Openscapes mentors cohort sheet)\n\nOpen Science / Open Data News: Share yours inDRAFT of OS/OD Weekly Updates and reuse/remix from each other to share back out in your newsletters\nReadings: \n\nAgile teams don’t work without psychological safety skills\nThe changing skill-set needed for project leaders\n\nOptional themed seaside chat. Wednesday, December 6, 3:30 - 4:30 ET / 12:30 - 1:30 PT (30 mins earlier than last time). This session will be on Cloud Computing. You will get a brief introduction to JupyterHubs, which is a popular platform for cloud computing. You’ll get to play around on a JupyterHub set up on NOAA’s Azure account. The hub has both RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks loaded. We will discuss how cloud computing platforms streamline and accelerate open science by increasing reproducibility and removing the “set-up” phase of a computing environment. \n\n\n\n\nCall 5 Reflections and shaping future plans\nCelebrating what you’ve all accomplished together, and this is just the beginning!\n\nGetting closure on a shared experience - individual reflection to notice progress and set goals, physical pen & paper for the mind-body process\nSharing challenges - in a space built on trust over time\nNote-taking shortcuts - Em’s efficiency tip sharing a new Google Doc feature for adding meeting notes, attendees list, and actions checklist \nStrategic organizing and planning - seeing how Mentors’ cohort fits with upcoming year to support colleagues and broader NMFS open science initiatives\nValue of microlearnings and microcommunications - the idea of reusing pieces of the blog post content as microcommunications in open science newsletters, as messages to colleagues, or to share in a meeting\nReading out loud from source material - emphasizing other people’s work and giving credit by directly reading rather than summarizing\n\n\nContinue our momentum!\n\nCowork to co-write a blog post: Wednesday, December 20, 4 - 5pm ET; 1 - 2 pm PT (we’ve sent a calendar invite). \nSeaside Chats: join or host a topic-based Seaside Chat in the New Year\n\nShare in NMFS Openscapes Mentors Google Space and Calendar\nReport out in SeasideChats_ReportOuts [ nmfs-openscapes-mentors ]\n\nOpen Science / Open Data News: Share yours in DRAFT of OS/OD Weekly Updates and reuse/remix from each other to share back out in your newsletters\nBook club: Join the Openscapes Slack #bookclub channel\nExpress your interest in the Winter 2024 Openscapes Champions Program Champions_Interest_Winter2024 [ NMFS-Openscapes ].",

Pop in and out.\n\nBrief closing to share what you did & any resources!\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent flavors of coworking\nOur practice of coworking has evolved, particularly through running 4 simultaneous NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022. We use a few flavors now. The take home message is that people can experiment with this practice and see what works for them!\n\nCohort coworking is outlined above and is the standard format we use in Openscapes Champions Cohorts between Calls. In some sessions, we would invite a participant in advance to “screenshare-and-tell” something they did or learned relating to the previous lesson (in the first 5 minutes to get things going). Some teams used these for their Seaside Chats.\nThemed coworking was an experiment in Fall 2022 as a way to bring participants together across Cohorts. These were 1.5-hr sessions with Eli Holmes giving a lesson, followed by coworking in breakout rooms. Typically people stayed in the main room for Q & A.\n\nSmall group or 1:1 coworking is described in (Butland & Penfold 2020).\n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nChampions teams will hold Seaside Chats, and we share suggested topics each Cohort Call.\n\n\nGit / GitHub drop-in help\nAfter the GitHub Clinic lesson it might be helpful to offer optional drop-in help sessions for folks to get set up with Git and GitHub on their local machines.\nEli Holmes recorded 4 short videos that people should watch before attending:\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nIn the Fall 2022 NMFS Cohorts we learned that many people needed help finding where Git was installed on their Windows machines, for example. Collaborative notes with screenshots were added in Google doc: OpenscapesCoworkingCross-Cohort [ 2022-nmfs-fall ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample invitation to Git / GitHub drop-in sessions\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve scheduled 30-minute drop-in sessions for those who want to get their computer connected to Git and GitHub. Drop in and we’ll get you set up!\nWhat should I install beforehand? GitHub Desktop. This is a great option and is especially good if your GitHub repos have files from multiple programs (R, Python, Excel, Word, images, data files). If you install GitHub Desktop, you will have Git installed with that. If you don’t get GitHub Desktop, then you will need to have Git installed.\nOnce you have GitHub Desktop installed, watch the short videos from Eli Holmes to see how to get things set up.\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nGive it a try and if you have any trouble getting connected, come to the drop-in sessions and we’ll help!\n\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\n\nSee Tip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar for instructions on how to implment this.",

We’re using GitHub teams to group folks involved in each cohort and easily tag them.

This may differ for organizations that cannot use Google products and use MS Teams for example.\nHere’s what to include, in this order, to create calendar invites for a cohort before finally adding participants:\n\ncohort name e.g. Openscapes Cohort-A Champions Calls\ndescription text with Champions teams as primary audience and Mentors as secondary audience.\n\n“Welcome! This is a Champions Cohort for NMFS Openscapes; one of three this fall.”\nlink to empty Cohort Google Folder\nlink to Cohort GitHub repo\nmore text later about everything a Cohort involves e.g. Cohort Calls, optional Coworking, Seaside Chats. Cohort Folder contains all Agendas, recordings, etc\n\nAttach empty Cohort Folder e.g. Openscapes-CohortCalls [ cohort-name ] (create an empty one if it doesn’t already exist). Folder will ultimately contain Call Agendas, recordings, etc. (we learned in fall 2022 that folks go to Calendars to find the docs for meetings)\nAdd Zoom or Google Meet link\nadd Mentors’ emails as Guests, potentially using a Google Group. Mentors names and emails are in OpenscapesParticipantsMainList sheet (also in an organization-specific sheet e.g. OpenscapesParticipants [ nmfs-mentors ])\nAdd Champions as Guests last. Adding them last prevents confusion from receiving multiple notifications and we know that Outlook Calendar users do not see updates in their calendars and has resulted in people having the wrong meeting link. Add as much info as you can before adding Mentors and Champions to a calendar invite.\n\nYou can invite up to 200 people to an event. In the past, Google did not provide the actual limit number so our strategy was to add ~80 Guests initially, then add additional blocks of 40 Guests on subsequent days. We learned this the hard way for Cross-Cohort Coworking sessions for 4 NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022 when we had ~160 potential participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we ask people add an event to their own Google Calendar without being added explicitly as a Guest. To do this, in a Calendar Event &gt; click the 3 dots &gt; Publish event &gt; choose Copy Link to event and share link in Slack or email saying “Click URL to add this to your Google Calendar”. We have used this to let people in a Cohort know of an optional impromptu session like drop-in GitHub help, or a screenshare-and-tell for example. The event must be in a public calendar for this to work.",

They require at least two team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical aside\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 we experimented having GitHub Clinics as stand-alone events between Cohort Calls 1 and 2, offering them twice, as well as the recording as part of team’s Seaside Chats. In some Cohorts it was difficult for participants to make extra time outside of the Cohort Calls, and it was extra scheduling for everyone. In 2022 we reinstated the GitHub Clinic into Cohort Call 2, and increased the number of Cohort Calls to 5.\n\n\n\n\n10.1 Overview\nJulie recorded videos of her teaching the GitHub Clinic to enable others to teach it. These are linked in the Openscapes Lesson Series book.\nDuring the Clinic, the Tech Host will make breakout groups, either based on their actual research team or as a random breakout group, depending on whether they attend with their team. We use the Cohort’s ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we may ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team.\nThe Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares (more recently we do not screenshare slides after Cohort Call 1; we do screenshare the live demos in the GitHub Clinic).\nTeam members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.\nPreparing for the GitHub Clinic involves:\n\ntechnical setup with kyber\nreviewing the slides and live demos\n\n\n\n10.2 Technical setup with kyber\nTo set up GitHub Clinics, we recommend using the kyber R package created by Sean Kross. kyber automates adding participants’ GitHub usernames to a Team that can write to the GitHub repo, and creates a set of markdown files such that each person has their own name.md to play around in. You can also do this “by hand” at github.com and copy-paste files from other cohorts if you prefer (we did this for the first few Champions cohorts!). Also, setting up with GitHub Clinic is not Openscapes-specific so you don’t need to be leading an Openscapes event to use kyber!\nBefore the GitHub Clinic, we ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - as part of their task following the previous Cohort Call. 1-2 days before the Clinic we email a reminder for folks to share their username with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample email for GitHub username reminder\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject: Openscapes - your GitHub username for Call 02\nHi All,\nWe’re looking forward to the GitHub Clinic on Wednesday for Cohort Call 02! We will be adding you all to a [year-cohort-name-cohort] GitHub Team so that you can participate. Please share your GitHub username today if possible.\nAdd your GitHub username to the Cohort_ParticipantList [ year-cohort-name ] spreadsheet in our Cohort Folder, column F. Creating a GitHub account for the first time? Here’s some username advice.\nNo prior knowledge needed for the Clinic!\nCheers, Stef\n\n\n\nFrom RStudio, within the Cohort repository (example 2022-noaa-afsc), follow kyber Github Clinic instructions. Make sure you pull before starting in case there are any updates you don’t have locally. You might be prompted to install some other R packages called by kyber.\nTo prepare for the Clinic, we do the following:\n\nAdd all usernames with member privileges to a GitHub Team titled like 2022-noaa-afsc-cohort\nGive the Team access to the Cohort repo\nCreate each person’s name.md files",
