Through this, mentors will identify and co-create on common resources and activities – such as code or databases for identical tasks or community developed standard practices – so there is less reinventing at each center.\nThe FY24 mentor cohort will start with a mentors-only Openscapes cohort (facilated bi-weekly group meetings) during which Openscapes will guide the mentor cohort in discussing the needs and challenges for adoption of Open Science in NMFS and to develop actions to take. The facilitated meetings are virtual and twice monthly. Mentors will also collaborate asynchronously (e.g. Google Chat, GitHub). During the fall session, mentors will learn and practice coaching and mentoring skills in preparation for the winter Champions cohorts. We will also start identifying cross-center roadblocks that mentors can collaborate on throughout the next years.\n\nTimeline & topics\n\nDates: Twice monthly starting October 17, 2023\nTimes: 12:00 - 1:30pm PT / 3:00 - 4:30 pm ET\nLocation: Remotely, via Google Meet\n\n\n\nMentor Calls\nMentor Calls are when we convene as a group to learn and plan. Agendas A public copy of our Agendas is available for reuse and remixing; an original is used during the calls as an archive of our live notetaking.\n\n\n\nDate\nMentor Call Topics\n\n\n\n\n10/17\n1. Openscapes mindset for mentors: What does it mean to be a mentor? What does Open Science at our org mean?\n\n\n10/31\n2. Developing strong Open and Collaborative Communities\n\n\n11/14\n3.

Reflections and shaping future plans\n\n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nSeaside Chats are for small-group coworking in weeks alternating between Mentor Calls. Topics are to reflect with your other center mentors in-between cross-center cohort calls. Note that participants from different centers or offices can have Seaside chats together. We will organize our Seaside chats after the first mentor calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nSeaside co-working sessions\n\n\n\n\nWeek of 10/23\nBegin work on an Open Science Pathway for your center, office or program.

We’re preparing for a Sept 20 kickoff to onboard new mentors, and have a light outline of plans here: https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/mentors.html#current-activities.\nThis cross-DAAC mentor community is creating & teaching resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the cloud. The expected time commitment is 3 days/month per year (and this ebbs and flows with your deadlines). This accounts for ~6 hours/month of synchronous calls with the rest of the time being self-directed towards improving support approaches for specific DAACs. You’ll be collaborating with others at your DAAC as well as across DAACs and the broader open science community. Please talk with your supervisor to make sure you are supported in alignment with your job; we will share with EOSDIS and HQ as well.\nWe’ll soon add you to calendar invites. If you’d have time for a 1:1 intro in the next few weeks, that would be super – we can share more and answer any questions you have ahead of our Sept 20 kickoff. The week of Sept 5 I’m available most days between 11-2pm PT if you’d have 30 minutes to chat.\nCheers, Julie\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteFollowup email example\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the NASA Openscapes Mentor Community!\nHi Sean, Alicia, Guoqing,\nIt was great to meet you and we’re really excited Guoqing will be joining the NASA Openscapes Mentor community from OBDAAC!

We’ll add new resources to this top of this list.\n\nFederal Data Science Management\nFederal Data Science Management - Jordan Read, December 2022. In this blog post, Read reflects on 10 years building the data science program at USGS, focused o team building and hiring, turning constraints into strengths and support, and walks through several points with a format of “justifications, considerations, example”. Throughout, he uses a great water-gardener metaphor and beautiful illustrations. Jordan’s now director at CUAHSI.\n\n\nDirect Education\nFacilitating Group Learning: Strategies for success with diverse learners - George Lakey.\n\nDirect education is highly experiental, using a variety of methods to move participants out of their comfort zones and into encounters with new possibilities…Direct education is multicultural and integrates perspectives developed by movements against sexism, racism, and other forms of oppression\n\n\n\nTime to Say Goodbye to Our Heroes?\nTime to Say Goodbye to Our Heroes? - Lindy Elkins-Tanton\n\n\n\n\nTalking about data science: Hilary Parker & Roger Peng\nRStudio::conf(2020) keynote & NSSD podcast episode 100\n\nIf you want to write, you read a lot, music, you listen a lot. I’ts hard to do this with data analysis.\n\n\n\nOpinionated analysis development\nParker 2017, PeerJ\n\n\nPrinciples for data analysis workflows\nStoudt, Vásquez & Martinez, 2021, PLOS Computational Biology\nhttps://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008770\n\nworkflow describes what a researcher does to make advances on scientific ques- tions: developing hypotheses, wrangling data, writing code, and interpreting results. Workflow: The process that moves a scientific investigation from raw data to coherent research question to insightful contribution. This often involves a complex series of pro- cesses and includes a mixture of machine automation and human intervention. It is a nonlinear and iterative exercise.\n\n\nImportantly, the difficulties we encounter in this [Explore] phase help us build empathy for an eventual audience beyond ourselves. It is here that we experience firsthand the challenges of processing our data set, framing domain research questions appro- priate to it, and structuring the beginnings of a workflow. Documenting our trial and error helps our own work stay on track in addition to assisting future researchers facing similar challenges.\n\n\n\nBrené Brown\nPower of Vulnerability: TED Talk\nDare To Lead Podcast - many episodes here. One in particular: with Lisa Lahey on Immunity to Change. They expect to talk about this academically but then workshop one of Brené’s needs. Notes from Julie:\n\nIt’s specifically about setting more deliberate meetings with your team so you’re not overwhelmed by so many one-off communications, and really getting to the root of why that feels so out of control for you, and about how to make true change in yourself outside of that New Year’s resolution model that feels so crushing and shameful when you can’t meet those this. This provides a different model that is much more profound and provides incremental change. This is about identifying the true cause of things and setting up small experiments for yourself that are actionable so you can test them and get feedback on what’s working and not so you can feel more agency and control in your day-to-day life. And in that help others too. I see so much benefit of this in my work and in my family. I want others to hear this too and think about how it can empower them as well.\n\n\n\nHedgehog concept: Jim Collins\nHedgehog concept\n\n\nAll We Can Save: Ayana Johnson & Katharine Wilkinson\nAll We Can Save Project\n\nThere is a renaissance blooming in the climate movement: leaderhip that is more characteristically feminine and more faithfully feminist, rooted in ompassion, connection, creativity, and collaboration. …To change everything, we need everyone — All We Can Save\n\n\nJohnson’s frustration with the climate movement isn’t about the current leaders doing a bad job—it’s just that we need more leaders. Her vision of the world includes people from every community in climate leadership roles. — The Marine Biologist Building an Inclusive Climate Movement, Vice\n\n\nAll We Can Save is basically a community bound between two covers, and a gift to any who wishes to join in. - Eric Roston, Bloomberg\n\n\n\nThe Power of Welcome\nThe Value of Welcome — Stef Butland, rOpenSci\n\n\nThe moment of lift: Melinda Gates\n\n\nArchitecture of Participation: Tim O’Reilly\nIt’s Not About You: The Truth About Social Media Marketing (2012). Strategy on community building through modern channels\n\n“We tell big stories that matter to a community of users, and together we use those stories to amplify a message that we all care about…And once they start telling their story as part of the bigger story, it suddenly looks like a parade.”\n\nOpen source paradigm shift\n\nI’ve come to use the term “the architecture of participation” to describe the nature of systems that are designed for user contribution.\n\n\n\nSystems Change: Donella Meadows\nLeverage points: places to intervene in a system: (in increasing order of effectiveness)\n\nConstants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).\nThe sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.\nThe structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).\nThe lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.\nThe strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.\nThe gain around driving positive feedback loops.\nThe structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).\nThe rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).\nThe power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.\nThe goals of the system.\nThe mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.\nThe power to transcend paradigms.\n\n\nSo how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.\n\n\n\nOrganizational architecture\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 6 – How Britain Invented, Then Ignored, Blitzkrieg.\nThis tale is about how the organizational architecture of existing entities - whether the British army, Sony, Kodak, or Xerox - cannot always support their own innovation because of the social structures they were built upon. Fascinating to think about in terms of how open science has not been embraced by scientific communities within the existing academic structure.\n\n\nDisruption can feed creativity\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 7 – Bowie, jazz, and the unplayable piano.\nThis tale is about music: how Keith Jarrett reluctantly played on a broken piano and how David Bowie and Brian Eno’s take on collaboration led to brand new sounds and ideas. I think about this for science and openness - working out of your comfort zones and mixing up how you do it and who you do it with.\n\n\nKaitlyn Thaney\nFunding research infrastructure\n\nthere’s also the fact that the current funding model has led to a perceived sense of scarcity, pushing open projects to compete rather than collaborate, to build new features instead of maintaining their work and deepening their level of service for their communities. An additional dimension to our work involves looking at the staffing and human infrastructure powering open technology development, maintenance, governance and stewardship. That volunteer labor and community engagement is often an invisible cost we gloss over in our estimations and recommendations, while also being a core pillar in this work.",

Our approach for doing better, more reproducible and inclusive team science in less time, is to first support scientists to create workflows that allow sharing with themselves (Future You) as well as with their teams and collaborators (Future Us). Future Us considers our teams, communities, and those who will be joining and continuing our work, whether that is next hours, weeks or decades (Lowndes & Robinson, 2021).\nOften we find that research teams are not sharing openly, internally among themselves. By considering and creating practices that support Future Us, the Openscapes approach helps research groups reimagine data analysis, develop modern data management and sharing skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches promote kinder science through technical tooling and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.\nOpenscapes Champions is a mentorship and professional development opportunity for scientific research teams to explore open data science, including data management and sharing practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend a Champions cohort series as a team with their research group in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g., R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), participants develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research and work, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture.\nThrough the Champions cohort series, a cohort of 6-8 teams will meet 5 times over 2 months for 1.5-hour video calls. These small-time requirements over longer time frames enable incremental change, accountability, and community building within the realities of scientists’ busy schedules and varying expertise and needs.\nChampions Cohort Goals\nThe goals of the Champions cohort series is to help teams normalize open data science discussions, identify shared needs and how to address them, and how to think ahead so they can more effectively onboard themselves and others on new (and existing) projects.

We will meet as a Cohort via Zoom five times over two months for 1.5 hours, on alternating Thursdays or Fridays. We propose the following three options (we’ll send Google Calendar Invites when confirmed). Would these times work for us:\n\n\nOption 1) Thursdays at 12-1:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28, November 11\n\n\nOption 2) Thursdays at 2-3:30 pm ET. Dates: September 16 & 30, October 14 & 28, November 11\n\n\nOption 3) Fridays at 12-1:30 pm ET. Dates: September 17, October 1, 15 & 29, November 12",

We draft Digests in this same doc.\n\n\nDigests\nWe send digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday). This gives people a touch point in the week between Calls. Digests include links to the Call’s agenda, the Call’s goals, slides, and some excerpts from the shared notes.\nCall 1 Digest is sent via email, and following the GitHub Clinic, the rest are sent via GitHub Issues as a way to continue practicing throughout the cohort. When posting as an issue, tag the cohort GitHub team like @Openscapes/2022-noaa-sefsc-summer-cohort so they get email notification.\nWe develop these in a single “DebriefsDigests” Google Doc along with our field notes (above).

Below is a light digest of Call 01, including a reminder about your Seaside Chat to think through your Pathway trailhead.\nAs a reminder of tasks for next time: have your first ‘seaside chat’ with your team and discuss where are you now? \nWe’ll send each of you an invitation to Openscapes Slack. Here’s a short Slack orientation to help you get comfortable. The 2023-cohort-name channel is a private space to connect with each other, and other community channels are to engage with folks from previous cohorts and the broader Openscapes Community. Joining Slack is optional, another tool for you to experiment with.\nHave a good week,\nStef, Julie, Co-lead, Co-lead\nDigest: Cohort Call 01 [ year-cohort-name ]\nOpenscapes_CohortCalls [ year-cohort-name ] (TODO: add link) Google folder - contains agendas, recordings, pathways \nhttps://openscapes.github.io/year-cohort-name/ (TODO: add link) - cohort webpage\nGoals: We started working towards a common understanding of the Openscapes mindset and what your pathway forward looks like for your team.\nTask: please see the Agenda doc (under Closing) (TODO: add link) for more details\n\nHave a Seaside Chat (meet with your team) & reflect together on what you’ve learned so far \n(optional) Attend Coworking.

It’s a nice practice that our team does together (to work on your own but have a buddy available over Zoom) and it’s nice to offer as a practice to the Champions too. Champions have said they appreciate this as a practice to take back to their research groups and it’s also a nice way to continue to build community and a learning culture and practice talking about data needs and screensharing.\nWe set up an hour of Coworking in the weeks between Cohort Calls. These are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Here is an agenda template OpenscapesCoworking [ year-cohort-name ].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample Coworking agenda\n\n\n\n\n\nWe share what we’re going to work on, and then work quietly and then check in at the end as well. We also make breakout rooms for Q&A if folks want to screenshare and talk things out.\n\nBrief intros to share what we’re planning to work on\nCreate breakout rooms based on topics, and you can move yourself. Today:\n\nProjectBoards\nChattierRoom - Eli there for Q&A. Pop in and out.\n\nBrief closing to share what you did & any resources!\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent flavors of coworking\nOur practice of coworking has evolved, particularly through running 4 simultaneous NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022. We use a few flavors now. The take home message is that people can experiment with this practice and see what works for them!\n\nCohort coworking is outlined above and is the standard format we use in Openscapes Champions Cohorts between Calls. In some sessions, we would invite a participant in advance to “screenshare-and-tell” something they did or learned relating to the previous lesson (in the first 5 minutes to get things going). Some teams used these for their Seaside Chats.\nThemed coworking was an experiment in Fall 2022 as a way to bring participants together across Cohorts. These were 1.5-hr sessions with Eli Holmes giving a lesson, followed by coworking in breakout rooms. Typically people stayed in the main room for Q & A.\n\nSmall group or 1:1 coworking is described in (Butland & Penfold 2020).\n\n\n\n\nSeaside Chats\nChampions teams will hold Seaside Chats, and we share suggested topics each Cohort Call.\n\n\nGit / GitHub drop-in help\nAfter the GitHub Clinic lesson it might be helpful to offer optional drop-in help sessions for folks to get set up with Git and GitHub on their local machines.\nEli Holmes recorded 4 short videos that people should watch before attending:\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nIn the Fall 2022 NMFS Cohorts we learned that many people needed help finding where Git was installed on their Windows machines, for example. Collaborative notes with screenshots were added in Google doc: OpenscapesCoworkingCross-Cohort [ 2022-nmfs-fall ]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample invitation to Git / GitHub drop-in sessions\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve scheduled 30-minute drop-in sessions for those who want to get their computer connected to Git and GitHub. Drop in and we’ll get you set up!\nWhat should I install beforehand? GitHub Desktop. This is a great option and is especially good if your GitHub repos have files from multiple programs (R, Python, Excel, Word, images, data files). If you install GitHub Desktop, you will have Git installed with that. If you don’t get GitHub Desktop, then you will need to have Git installed.\nOnce you have GitHub Desktop installed, watch the short videos from Eli Holmes to see how to get things set up.\n\nSetting GitHub Desktop Preferences (2.5 mins)\nCloning a repository (2 mins)\nPulling and pushing changes to GitHub (3.5 mins)\nTurning an existing directory into a Git repository and pushing to GitHub (2 min)\n\nGive it a try and if you have any trouble getting connected, come to the drop-in sessions and we’ll help!\n\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\nDate / time (click to add to your Google Cal)\n\nSee Tip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar for instructions on how to implment this.",

We offer mentorship, coaching, teaching, and community organizing centered around open data science: we help teams develop collaborative practices that are more reproducible, transparent, inclusive, and kind.\nOpenscapes Champions is an open data science mentorship program for science teams. We support researchers to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. We work with academic, government, and non-profit research teams who become part of the open science movement as Champions empowered with new skillsets and mindsets for modern data-intensive science.",

    "text": "About This Guide\nWe’ve been growing Openscapes since founding it in 2018. This is our attempt to codify our approach so that we can onboard others as we grow. Aligned with our values for kinder, open science, we are developing it openly and designing it so that you can also use the guide to use the Openscapes Approach on your own. We encourage anyone to use and “fork” it to make it your own (particularly as it’s a bit more developed!).\nWe complete a full revolution of our Flywheel (see Robinson & Lowndes 2022) each time we lead the Champions Program.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 from Robinson & Lowndes 2022. The Openscapes Flywheel builds momentum as a culture change engine as We engage a Future Us mindset through welcoming and creating space and place, we Empower a learning culture by investing in learning and trust, and working openly, and we amplify open leaders by leveraging common open data science workflows, skills and tools and inspire broader scientific culture change. And the Flywheel turns again.\n\n\nEach turn of the flywheel delivers the Champions program for a Cohort of research teams so that they can begin transforming their workflows towards kinder, inclusive open science and inspire their broader communities. We support this delivery and transformation through developing mentor teams with inclusive facilitation skills, by investing in the Champions curriculum as we learn new software and inclusive practices and to meet specific Cohort needs, and by attracting research teams through storytelling (talks, blogs, publications), community engagement, and artwork to welcome more folks to the open science movement.\nThis book will ultimately describe the Openscapes Approach as all parts of our Flywheel, but we are beginning our focus on Champions Program and then the Mentors Framework.\n\nThe Flywheel is a concept developed by Jim Collins in the book Good to Great; it’s the idea that when building something to last, there is no single defining action. Rather, the process resembles relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond. We’ve found these are the synergistic and overlapping elements for open data science movement building which we’ve tested, iterated, and refined in working with over 150 research teams since 2019. We are really focused on building habits that last, and institutional change that lasts.\n\n\nBuilt with Quarto\nWe’re collaboratively making the Openscapes Approach Guide with Quarto. Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown, which we use to openly develop and publish all Openscapes websites, books, and blogs. Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered natively using Jupyter and Knitr engines. We are gradually converting to build all our materials with Quarto.",

    "section": "Slack",
    "text": "Slack\n\nWelcome to Openscapes Slack 🤗!\nHave you received an invitation to join Openscapes Slack? Here’s some information to help you get comfortable.\nAbout: This is a diverse open science community. We use Slack as a way for people to connect with each other. We want it to be a supportive, trust-based community of folks doing data intensive science. Members include, but are not limited to, people who have participated in a Champions Program, NASA or NOAA Fisheries Openscapes Frameworks, Pathways to Open Science, Reflections, earthaccess contributors, NASA Cloud Cookbook Hackdays, or other Openscapes programs, and their collaborators. Current Slack members can invite others to join - an informal sponsorship approach. These are reviewed and approved by an Openscapes core team member.\nHow do I use it? Slack can feel like a daunting new tool, especially when we’re introducing lots of new tools during Champions Cohorts. There are both technical and etiquette aspects to getting comfortable. For technical tips see Getting started for new members and How to use Slack. This Slack quick start guide (Woodley and Pratt (2020)) from the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement includes 1) configuring your account; 2) channels and notifications; 3) communicating.\nWhen you join, you’ll automatically land in several channels: #welcome, #cool-finds, #events, #general, #random, #shared-joy 🌈. You can browse other channels, like #jobs-funding and choose to join them. People are invariably friendly and open to asking and answering questions. You can get a feel for how things work by “listening” to the discussions, then jump in!\nThe #welcome channel is a place for new members to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to help them feel welcome by adding an emoji or saying “I work on sea turtles too!”. Here’s a short read on The Value of #Welcome.\nIf you’re part of a cohort for an Openscapes program you may be invited to a private cohort channel. Open isn’t all or nothing; being open with the peers you’re getting to know is a good way to start getting comfortable with the Slack community more broadly.\nOpenscapes uses the free Slack plan. This means we can all see message history for the previous 90 days. We do this partly to encourage good open documentation practices: if you are discussing workflow or software development, decisions should be put in (open) documentation and not in Slack.\n\n\nChannel purposes\nThese definitions are meant to help people know where to post or ask questions. They are listed in the Slack channel Topic and Description (because the Topic preview is easily visible in the channel, while the Description, not so much).\n#welcome: A place for people new to our community to introduce themselves and for the rest of us to make them feel welcome; the default channel that members cannot leave if they leave all other channels.\n#general: A place to discuss ongoing progress, friendly Q & A about good enough practices, team culture, tools. Announcements from the Openscapes team and others.\n\n#events: Events that might be of interest to others in our community. Openscapes events also go in #general.\n#cool-finds: Posts, datasets, podcasts, repos, papers, videos, packages, …things you found that are cool.\n#jobs-funding: Job opportunities, seeking work, offers to connect people with those “on the inside”.\n#shared-joy: Sharing joy of any shape or size.\n#random: Hallway conversations.\nteam-openscapes: (private) ~daily checkins. We started this when our team grew in 2024 so that Stef and I weren’t in DMs anymore. Like we did during mentor-coaching, we check in here daily when we’re working on Openscapes stuff to say hi and give a heads up about what we’re working on. For Stef, Andy, and me this is almost daily, for Liz and Ileana, it’s less so and when it’s makes sense for them, since they’re less time. We tag people when they’re needed directly so if it’s better for you to not be notified until you’re tagged that is great too.\n\n\nInvite someone to Openscapes Slack\nInviting someone to join Openscapes Slack? In an email or other communication, send them the link to Welcome to Openscapes Slack 🤗! and a link to join.\nTo create a link to join Slack, in the app, Invite people to join Openscapes , choose 🔗Copy invite link. 99% of the time, we do not invite someone by adding their email to invite from inside the Slack app. Why? With the free plan, we are not able to send a custom invitation note from inside Slack, and with our paid plan we were not able to add a URL to a custom note to provide our welcome info.\nThe channels people join by default are set in the browser admin interface Settings & Permissions &gt; Default Channels. Currently #welcome, #cool-finds, #events, #general, #random, #shared-joy.\n\n\nChange the email you use in Slack\nPeople change jobs and might want to change the email they use in Slack to continue to use it without creating a new profile. Users can do this on their own. Workspace Owners or Admins cannot do this on a user’s behalf on the free plan. In the app, open your profile (click on your profile icon in lower left to open profile) &gt; click three dots to select Account Settings &gt; This will open your account in the web interface. Click Email Address &gt; expand &gt; add your password and your new email address. (If at first you don’t succeed at this step, try again.) You’ll need to accept the confirmation email sent to your new address.\n\n\nSet Slack reminders\nHere’s an example of how to set a Slackbot reminder for recurring meetings, in this case, biweekly. Add links to “zoom link” and “notes”.\n/remind #earthaccess “Our earthaccess hack starts in 1 hour! Here is the meeting zoom link and the notes” at 9AM every other Tuesday\nHere’s how it appears in Slack:\n“Reminder: Our earthaccess hack starts in 1 hour! Here is the meeting zoom link and the notes”\n\n\nSlack integration with GitHub\nWe haven’t implemented this, but the how-to is here.\nWe’d love for most resource sharing and conversations to happen in the open and in a more persistent location than Slack. Places like GitHub Discussions are great for this. Thanks to Matt Fisher for getting us started with Slack notifications for GitHub Discussions.\nWe can subscribe Slack channels by repository and event types we’re interested in. In Slack, we can run /github help to get some more info on the command to modify subscriptions. Full documentation.\n\nExample\nThe Slack #nasa-mentors channel is set to get notified of new and answered discussions for just the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook GitHub repo. The subscription process was started with this command:\n/github subscribe NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook discussions\nThe above will subscribe to “discussions” in addition to undesirable default notifications. We can unsubscribe from the defaults to quiet it down with another comment:\n/github unsubscribe NASA-Openscapes/earthdata-cloud-cookbook issues pulls commits releases deployments",

    "text": "Zenodo\nWe cover a lot here - the Zenodo Openscapes Community, getting a DOI, guidance for citing our work. See the subheadings in the navigation bar to the right to jump to a section.\nWe want to share our material in a way that other people can find it, use it, improve it, and cite it. For our lesson materials, like Champions Cohorts, this provides a robust way for people to add their participation to their CV as professional development. We use the Zenodo repository and a Zenodo Openscapes Community for this purpose.\nZenodo is a general-purpose open repository that allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citable (adapted from Wikipedia). Zenodo allows for versioning and we can preserve GitHub repositories in Zenodo. GitHub itself is not a repository. For the full picture, this 1-hr webinar is helpful: Zenodo: open digital repository | 2022.12.07.\nWe created a Zenodo Openscapes Community as a “semantically meaningful group” of research products using these example Zenodo Communities as inspiration: NASA’s Transform to Open Science; Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE).\nZenodo has a Sandbox in which one can create and refine a draft Community before creating the real thing. This webinar section “How to create a community” screenshares a walk-through that makes things crystal clear. Creating a Sandbox first forces you to recognize decisions to make before creating the real thing, like: needing to create it from an account that looks professional like “curator”, rather than a personal email username; or deciding what types of research products to include.\n\nWhat do we curate in our Zenodo Openscapes Community?\nAnyone can request to have their Zenodo record listed in the Zenodo Openscapes Community. Curator is Stefanie Butland via curator@openscapes.org. We don’t want to include everything; too big and its value diminishes. We do curate:\n\nResources on GitHub like the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, NASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook, Pathways to Open Science\n\nmake a “release” on GitHub and submit that to Zenodo, choose type = other, or lesson. See instructions in Documentation.\n\nkey blog posts like ESIP 2022, 2023 panels\n\ncreate and upload pdf of post from the website, choose type = other\n\nslide decks from key presentations\n\nupload pdf of slides, choose type = presentation\n\n\nWe do not curate datasets.\n\n\nHow to add your existing Zenodo record to the Zenodo Openscapes Community\nIf you own an existing Zenodo record you’d like to have listed, log into Zenodo, go to that record’s page, click yellow Edit button (top right) …\n\nIn the Edit page that appears, scroll to Communities section &gt; type “openscapes” and select it …\n\nClick Save &gt; click Publish (these appear at top and bottom of the edit page)\n\ncurator@openscapes.org will get email notification of your request and accept, or may ask for further information.\n\n\nHow to publish a new record in Zenodo to get a DOI\nVideo tutorial from OpenAIRE_eu (4.5 min)\n\nFor a blog post or presentation, save as pdf, filename: openscapes_post_name_year.pdf or slides_name_year.pdf, example: openscapes_post_noaa_afsc_2022.pdf\nLogin to Zenodo (login via GitHub is convenient), go to https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=openscapes and upload your pdf (files &gt; start upload). Using that link automatically includes your record in our community collection.\nUpload type\n\nblog post: Other\nslide deck: Presentation\n\nBasic information\n\nDigital Object Identifier: leave blank\nPublication date: date of blog post publication, or presentation\nTitle: title of post or presentation without adding version number\nAuthors / creators:\n\nWe can take advantage of back-end system links between Zenodo, ROR (Research Organization Registry), and ORCID to auto-complete names, ORCID IDs, and affiliations that will automatically appear in Zenodo records. Openscapes was assigned ROR ID ror.org/022je8241 in ROR release v1.67.\nStart typing the author’s name and select from a list of auto-complete options. If none is available, use author name consistent with other Zenodo records in their name; manually add their ORCID ID.\nAuthor’s affiliation: Start typing the affiliation name. For Openscapes and other orgs registered with ROR, you will see a dropdown list that includes one annotated as Source: ROR (preferred). Select that one to autocomplete. This will result in a ROR logo and link to Openscapes ROR record being linked in their affiliation (click ‘show affiliations’ in this example).\nWe keep a list of Openscapes authors ORCID IDs in OpenscapesParticipantsMainList Google sheet, Mentors tab\nIf the person has granted ORCID permission to auto-update from Zenodo, this new record will automatically appear in their ORCID profile. This is a pretty great bonus.\n\nDescription: for an Openscapes blog post, use the italicized preface; for a presentation, use the abstract. End with “Link to source blog post: URL”\nVersion (optional): We’ve settled on using CalVer: YYYY.0M (zero-padded month) since Luis López said “I like CalVer for books and environments” when we asked for advice. It’s a bit redundant with publication date.\nKeywords: To promote findability and consistency, we suggest using some of these keywords, based on those used by related records. Wow, keywords appear to be case sensitive. Search keywords:“Open Science” gives 1770 records; keywords:“open science” gives 1395 records; keywords:“open science” OR “Open Science” gives 11112 results (not sure why those don’t add up) (May 23, 2023)\n\nOpenscapes\nOpen Science\nNASA\nNOAA\nJupyterHub\ncloud computing\nconference name e.g. ESIP, AGU, SORTEE, FORCE11\nOpen Educational Resources (for lesson series)\n\n\nLicense: Open Access, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nFor GitHub releases that include code and documentation, we include a LICENSE.md file on GitHub, then on Zenodo we select Licence: Other (Attribution).\n\nFunding: Would be great to add this, but we’ve not established guidelines yet\nPublish! At very top or very bottom, right side of the page, click Save &gt; Publish &gt; I understand. Voila! Your Zenodo record is live.\n\nThe Zenodo Openscapes Community curator will be notified via email to approve inclusion of your record in the community.\nYou can edit things like keywords and the Cite as text without affecting the DOI. To make a change to the file(s) itself, you must upload a new version which will give a new DOI.\n\n\n\n\nHow to get a DOI for materials on GitHub\nThis section describes how to get a DOI for a “research related digital artefact” like our Quarto books on GitHub; it’s a work in progress, but should get you what you need.\nWe follow Metadocencia’s How-to Guidance by Yanina Bellini Saibene. It’s clear, has great annotated screenshots, and is also available in Spanish. Here are some specifics for us:\n\nStore the material in a repository that allows us to publish it, like GitHub.\nAdd an open license that makes it clear how people can use the material. The Openscapes Approach Guide license is adapted from The Turing Way license that accommodates works that include both code and documentation.\nConnect your GitHub Organization to Zenodo (we have already done this). This means that when we make a GitHub Release of our material, a Zenodo record with a DOI is automatically created.\nMake a GitHub Release of the material. Go to /releases e.g. https://github.com/Openscapes/pathways-to-open-science/releases to create a release because it doesn’t appear on the right of repository page automatically.\nReview and edit the Zenodo record that has been automatically created.This will likely involve editing the authors, their ORCID IDs, their affiliations. It’s best to find a author’s name by using the search. Selecting a person from the resulting list will add their ORCID ID. It’s important to find affiliations by using the search. Typing ‘Openscapes’ gives you a list to select from; choosing from that list ensures that the Openscapes affilation links to our ROR (Research Organization Registry) record. Save and publish the changes.\nAdd a “how to cite” section to the resource for which we’ve now got a DOI.\n\n\n\nAdd Citation guidance to Openscapes materials\nOnce we have a DOI, we need to let people know how to cite our resource. We like using Citing The Turing Way as an example to follow.\nWe add a ‘Citation’ section to the Welcome page, and a Zenodo DOI badge to its README on GitHub. Example: Here’s how we cite this Approach Guide and show its Zenodo badge in the README.\nThe “Cite as” section in a Zenodo record, in the right-side navigation bar allows you to copy-paste the citation in several formats. To get the markdown format for the badge, we click on the badge itself on our record’s Zenodo page; clicking on the ‘copy to clipboard’ symbol gets you only the URL for the record (which is why it’s really easy to forget how to get the badge info). The code to add a badge looks like this: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8034313.svg)] (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8034313)",

Screenshots below. Practice both beforehand, testing by recording yourself, because they’re not obvious and chances of working smoothly on the fly in a meeting are …low.\nScenario 1. During start of meeting, sharing welcome slides in a loop, with music from spotify playing so audience can hear, and people speaking does not disrupt music. See How to share audio with shared visuals.\n\nScenario 2. During interludes where people are silent journaling, to share audio only, not screen. See How to play audio or music without sharing your screen.\n\nIMPT: volume of shared sound is controlled in the source application. If spotify music is too loud, control volume in spotify (not your computer). See How to control the volume of a shared sound while in a meeting",

    "text": "Blogs\nWe write a lot of blog posts. They give visibility to things that are otherwise hidden. One example is writing a blog post for a workshop on Audience Building and Strategic Planning. This was a lot of work to put together, and we think it’s valuable for others! In addition to posting the slides, how could we amplify it more and tell a story around those slides that make it more sharable? That’s right, a blog post.\nBlog posts take time. A lot of time. And they often feel extra, especially in a culture of needing peer-reviewed publications. But they are super valuable, and important. So, here are some strategies we use to write blogs:\n\nReuse structure. Copy-paste a previous blog post structure. Ah, yes, we have the publish date, the title, the authors up top, some italics introducing what this is and who the authors are, with quick links. Then, 3-4 headers with up to 3 paragraphs each and a few pictures. Delete the content but start from there.\nReuse content. We spend a lot of time planning events and slides - reuse them! Copy text directly from the Agenda docs, and from the slides! Add text to shape the story, but then copy-paste as much as possible. This can be harder with posts that synthesize events (like the 2022 ESIP blog post and upcoming post for 2023). These events require more time to rewatch the recording and synthesize and identify themes, but there is still a lot to be reused, especially quotes!\nShare with co-authors early. But not too early. Often we are trying to do the legwork to get a blog post structured and drafted describing the work they’ve already put into the event or slides. So along with the next point, do this until it’s good enough, and share!\nBe ok with imperfect, and done! Yes, there is more to say if you put months of time into this. And we may find a sentence to be polished after posting, and that’s ok. We aim to share ideas and momentum from our community with the mindset that sharing some and imperfectly is better than silence.",

Following guidance from Ta7talíya Michelle Nahanee through her Nahanee Creative Territorial Acknowledgements Interactive Workshop, we omit the phrase “I would like to acknowledge” and jump right to the statements. Ideally we try to include an action so that people understand that these are more than just words. Here are some examples you can reuse or remix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample Land Acknowledgments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI live and work on the traditional lands of the Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] within Secwépemc’ulucw [she-KWE-pem-cooluc], the traditional and unceded territory of the Secwépemc [she-KWE-pem] peoples. One thing I do to learn more is attend the annual Kamloopa powwow. Kukstemcw (thank you!) for joining us today.\n\nTo learn more about the land(s) you’re on: https://native-land.ca/. You can also text your zip code to this number and it will tell you the land(s) you’re on: 1-907-312-5085.\n\nI work on endangered and threatened PNW salmonids. Salmon are central to the Native Nations of the Puget Sound region and coast, the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, Skokomish, Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakama Nations. I see the foresight of the leaders of the Pacific Northwest Native Nations who wrote in clauses to ensure perpetual access to their ancestral fishing locations in the treaties of the mid-1800s. I acknowledge the determination of the next generations who protested on the water and in the courts to force these treaties to be upheld. Now, I work to educate myself on this history and specifically on the Boldt Decision and its aftermath. As a federal employee, I am part of the system that upholds these treaties and court decisions. I am aware that I am not knowledgeable as I want to be and I want to work on this.\nI am grateful I am for the land where I am here in Santa Barbara California and I want to honor the Chumash peoples who have been and continue to be stewards of the lands and waters here.\n\nLand Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/. I’ve learned more about Indigenous sense of place through Robin Wall Kimmerer’s beautiful book Braiding Sweetgrass - Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants.\n\nI acknowledge that the Piscataway Indian Nation continues to maintain a relationship with the lands where I am here in Potomac, MD. The Piscataway Indian Nation received recognition by the State of Maryland in 2012. I acknowledge their long-standing kinship with these lands and waters. To make this statement more meaningful, I invite you to learn more about land acknowledgement statements via https://native-land.ca/ and other resources and to reconsider in what ways you can improve your relationship with the lands and waters you steward.\nI have lived and worked for more than 20 years on lands that are not mine, but those of the Narragansett. The Narragansetts are the namesakes for the town of Narragansett and of Narragansett Bay and they are the traditional caretakers of marine and fresh waters as well as the land that currently makes up most of the state of Rhode Island. To learn more about the Narragansetts and other native peoples of this land visit the Tomaquag Muesuem or consider their virtual programs. Land Acknowledgements are one way to amplify the knowledge and work of Indigenous peoples. Here’s a place you can go to learn more: https://native-land.ca/.\nI am grateful for the land where I am here in St. Petersburg Florida, and I want to honor the Seminole, Miccosukee, and Tocobaga people who took stewardship of this land and surrounding waters. I acknowledge the painful history of genocide and forced removal from their territory, and I respect and honor the diverse Indigenous people still connected to this land.\nThe territory that we now know as South Florida has been the traditional homelands of the Native nations including the Tequesta, the Calusa, and today the sovereign homelands of the Seminole and Miccosukee. I acknowledge that where I live, work, and recreate is located on the ancestral homelands of sovereign Native nations. I reflect on this and pay respects by learning more about ways to support our local Indigenous communities in efforts to preserve Seminole and Miccosukee cultures.",

    "section": "About Qualitative Research",
    "text": "About Qualitative Research\n\nWhat is Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA)?\nQualitative Data Analysis (QDA) or qualitative coding is a method of analyzing textual data. Textual data can be drawn from interview or focus group transcripts, observational notes, newspapers, blog posts, social media posts, books, texts and really anything related to the topic. These methods are commonly used in social science fields such as sociology, anthropology, political science, business, education, user experience design and more.\nWhile methods of doing qualitative analysis can vary depending on field and methodological background, the common denominator is that this form of research does what is called “qualitative coding” or qualitative data analysis. Sometimes folks use a computer to do QDA using software such as Taguette, NVivo, Dedoose, Atlas.TI or MaxQDA to name a few.\nFor those who have less experience in social science fields, the terminology of “coding” can be misleading because one might assume we are using the word coding in terms of writing code for analysis. However, this is not how qualitative researchers use the term coding.\nFor scientists, it can help to replace the word “coding” with a word like “annotating” or “tagging” because these terms are more descriptive about what it is that the researcher does in qualitative coding. While there are variations, the typical QDA process is for the researcher or research team to read through the qualitative materials and to develop codes to answer the research questions based on both 1) the patterns seen in the data itself and 2) theoretical and substantive knowledge of the field.\nTo do this, qualitative researchers often start with either existing research, metrics or previous qualitative codebooks to build their understanding of what the data might say and what they should look for.\nResearchers will then go through the data and code (or tag/annotate) selections of the text to summarize a theme or an idea found in the data. This can be as simple as taking short responses to a survey and annotating them with descriptive codes or as complex as using codes to tag quotes from hours long interviews or focus groups.\n\n\nA Note about Qualitative Research\nThere are a few differences in qualitative research that may not be apparent to those who are learning about how to do this work for the first time.\nFirst, In qualitative social science research, we are often using inductive rather than deductive research. In typical scientific research, there is an existing hypothesis and the research design is to test that hypothesis. By contrast, qualitative research may have a general research question that will evolve over the course of the research and inductively be explored. Meaning that we know that there is something here to study, but we aren’t always certain what it is that we’re looking at.\nA good analogy would be if we were a biologist going to a fictional planet to study the life that exists on that planet. We might already have categories of “tree” or “grass” or “bush” from our understanding of plant life on earth and we could use those to begin our work of categorizing what we see on a different planet. That said, we would be aware that these terms might be limited as we are looking at plant life we’ve never seen before. As we learn more about the environment, our categories to understand what we are looking at would evolve. Our research question would also likely evolve as we begin to find patterns and understand the ecosystem. In the same way, as we do qualitative research we are often creating systems to help us understand what we’re seeing/hearing and we’re adapting our research to integrate what we’re learning as we do it. This is how our research can be inductive.\nSecond, the motive and output of qualitative research can be quite distinct from quantitative studies. While it is possible to confirm or refute a hypothesis in qualitative research, it’s not as common as other forms of research output. For instance, qualitative research outputs could be: narratives, explanations of a process or an activity, a list of reasons why people did something, relevant language usage and terms that are unfamiliar. Our analysis might also give us a better understanding of the topic in order to do more research (of any kind), or to write a better research question. It might also be useful for developing relevant hypotheses to do more work on this topic area.\nThis work with Openscapes I would consider to be applied or practical research designed to support the aims of the organization. However when that is not true, such as when a qualitative study is being developed in the academy, the end result can also be to add to theory about a particular topic.",

    "text": "QDA for Openscapes\n\nHow we used QDA for Openscapes\nOur research question was “How does Openscapes support teams to transition from closed research practices to open research practices?” We then picked a cohort and decided to use the open agendas from that cohort to develop a codebook. We wanted to get a better sense of how they talked about open research in the agenda that we were looking at. Our hope was that the agendas would be a sort of “living document” that gave us insights into what the discussion was and how participants made meaning of the learning they were gaining in open research.\n\n\nHow we created the Qualitative Codebook for Openscapes Agendas\nInitially we began with the Theory of Change as a way to develop our system of codes/tags (or codebook). But we quickly realized that the categories from the Theory of Change didn’t map well onto the agendas. We changed to work from the Moore Foundation grant goals as a starting place, then when we began to see patterns in the data, we expanded from those goals and added more codes/tags to respond to what we saw in the data.\nThe final research paper reviewed the Moore Foundation goals, the way they showed up in the agendas as well as exploring the inductive topics that came up through the agendas. You can read the final report to see concrete examples.\nThe Openscapes leadership started by coding together and began to notice what worked and what didn’t in coding the agendas. As we went on, we began to add in some codes that we saw as we went through the data.\n\n\nQualitative Codebook\nHere is the codebook that we developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAdoptProtocol.io\nDiscussion of adopting protocols.io (Moore Goal)\n\n\nBuildCommunity\nDiscussion of building community across teams - broader sense of community beyond this group.

    "text": "Working with this QDA in Openscapes Going Forward\n\nDebriefs Following Calls as Data\nOne helpful way to do qualitative research in a collaborative setting is to use debrief calls after the main call is over to write down some of the key important aspects of the call. This allows it to be much easier to do the coding.\nThe team might ask themselves:\n\nWhat were the biggest topics of conversation in the call? What did people want to talk about?\nWhat kinds of questions were participants asking about?\nWhat challenge were they having?\nWhat were some of the wins that they talked about?\n\nThese notes should be added to the text that the team would use for analysis as a kind of “field note” of what the facilitators knew from the room.\nAdditionally, the debrief calls could also be a place where items in the document can be coded with multiple people looking at the document. Each person might take 3-4 codes and go through the document tagging them when they see them in the document. This would enable the coding process to be much less laborious. When there are issues or challenges, the team can talk about them, and consider adding or using certain codes when there are questions.\n\n\nHow to use Taguette\nI recommend that the Openscapes team use Taguette for doing qualitative coding as it is a FLOSS tool that is openly available and capable of collaboration among a group of people. There is documentation at this link for how to get started with Taguette: https://www.taguette.org/getting-started.html\nOver time, the research team may wish to do more complex QDA analyses with the data, however, I encourage the team to focus on the basics of the research instead of getting bogged down with the software. Taguette is a simple program but it does the basics well.\n\n\nUsing the Research\nAfter the cohort is finished and the agendas have been coded, the process of analysis of the research can begin. I encourage the team to consider conducting a synthesis meeting after the coding/tagging has been completed to go through each of the codes and to see what can be learned from each.\nFor instance, to consider over time how the challenges that the agendas shared, or the questions that participants asked can offer some insight into the way that teaching these topics could be done in the future.\n\n\nHow to update the Codebook\nWe can make changes to the codebook and should do so as the research continues. There are a few ways to consider making updates:\nFirst is to consider adding new codes to the codebook: When someone on the research team sees a topic of conversation in the agendas that seems to be a pattern (e.g. they see it in more than three places) and it is helpful to understand something about the research question, it’s a great idea to add a new code to the codebook.\nThe key question to ask before adding a new code/tag is to ask: “Does this code help us answer our research question?” If it does, it should be added. If it’s interesting but not a part of the research question, consider not including it. When adding a code, try to ensure that the one word code/tag makes sense on its own and that there is a written explanation of the definition of that code/tag.\nSecond, the research team may find themselves refining the codes and the explanations. As time goes on, the research team will develop a sense for the differences between codes, when to apply them and when not to. Part of the work is to make sure that the descriptions are clear for the team that is doing the coding and that it can be communicated to researchers in the future.\nThat said, I encourage the team to be careful of not complexifying the coding/tagging system too much. It’s a common mistake among beginner qualitative researchers to code EVERYTHING and to make a monstrous codebook with every small bit of data. Not everything needs to be coded. Be sure to refer back to “Is this going to help us understand the research question more effectively? When doing any editing.",

Our Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area.\nOpenscapes is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.\nDiversity is our strength, we try to cultivate a tone where everyone in the community, no matter their backgrounds and accomplishments, comes with a mind open to learning from, with, and for each other. In this mindset, questions are always welcome and appropriate because they don’t expose the lack of knowledge of the asker. Rather, questions expose opportunities for clarification for the original communicator, and for further opening up the conversation to include different perspectives and learning styles.\nIn our community we encourage listening and empathy in all of our interactions. This means:\nBe Respectful\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe Direct but Professional\nWe are likely to have some discussions about if and when criticism is respectful and when it’s not. We must be able to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve. We cannot withhold hard truths. Doing so respectfully is hard, doing so when others don’t seem to be listening is harder, and hearing such comments when one is the recipient can be even harder still. We need to be honest and direct, as well as respectful.\nBe Inclusive\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture, perspective, or background\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nIf you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back, encourage other voices to join in, and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Think of others’ perspectives, contributions, and needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the highest good for our community.\n\n\nSummary\nBe respectful, honest, inclusive, accommodating, appreciative, and open to learning from everyone else.\nDo not attack, demean, disrupt, harass, or threaten others or encourage such behavior.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the Openscapes community, including Openscapes staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction online including GitHub project repositories, remote calls, and in person at Openscapes -hosted events.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the organiser Julia Lowndes at openscapes @ nceas.ucsb.edu or independent community member Allison Horst at ahorst @ ucsb.edu with a description of what has occurred and any supporting information that would be helpful. After receiving a concise description of your situation, Julia or Allison will review the report and determine next steps. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\nThe Openscapes Code of Conduct is heavily drawn from rOpenSci and Mozilla, who we greatly appreciate for their leadership in this area (see Mozilla’s inclusion repo. Additional resources influencing this document include RStudio, Open Post Academics, and the groups described in open software means kinder science. Please also see the value and ethics statements from Ben Marwick’s lab as well as other inspiring examples from EpiEllie’s twitter thread and the coop at Fred Hutch.",

We’re excited to stay in touch (Slack, Twitter, etc) and will be sending out a last digest soon!\nWe’d appreciate your feedback in this [5-min survey] so we can improve based on feedback of what did and didn’t work. Additionally, please email/slack us a snail-mail address for your team so that we can send a thank you card and stickers!\nThanks again, and we hope you all have a safe and healthy break.\nCheers,\nJulie, Erin, Emma, and Lenny",

We’re using GitHub teams to group folks involved in each cohort and easily tag them.

This may differ for organizations that cannot use Google products and use MS Teams for example.\nHere’s what to include, in this order, to create calendar invites for a cohort before finally adding participants:\n\ncohort name e.g. Openscapes Cohort-A Champions Calls\ndescription text with Champions teams as primary audience and Mentors as secondary audience.\n\n“Welcome! This is a Champions Cohort for NMFS Openscapes; one of three this fall.”\nlink to empty Cohort Google Folder\nlink to Cohort GitHub repo\nmore text later about everything a Cohort involves e.g. Cohort Calls, optional Coworking, Seaside Chats. Cohort Folder contains all Agendas, recordings, etc\n\nAttach empty Cohort Folder e.g. Openscapes-CohortCalls [ cohort-name ] (create an empty one if it doesn’t already exist). Folder will ultimately contain Call Agendas, recordings, etc. (we learned in fall 2022 that folks go to Calendars to find the docs for meetings)\nAdd Zoom or Google Meet link\nadd Mentors’ emails as Guests, potentially using a Google Group. Mentors names and emails are in OpenscapesParticipantsMainList sheet (also in an organization-specific sheet e.g. OpenscapesParticipants [ nmfs-mentors ])\nAdd Champions as Guests last. Adding them last prevents confusion from receiving multiple notifications and we know that Outlook Calendar users do not see updates in their calendars and has resulted in people having the wrong meeting link. Add as much info as you can before adding Mentors and Champions to a calendar invite.\n\nYou can invite up to 200 people to an event. In the past, Google did not provide the actual limit number so our strategy was to add ~80 Guests initially, then add additional blocks of 40 Guests on subsequent days. We learned this the hard way for Cross-Cohort Coworking sessions for 4 NOAA NMFS Cohorts in Fall 2022 when we had ~160 potential participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTip: Click URL to add to your Google Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we ask people add an event to their own Google Calendar without being added explicitly as a Guest. To do this, in a Calendar Event &gt; click the 3 dots &gt; Publish event &gt; choose Copy Link to event and share link in Slack or email saying “Click URL to add this to your Google Calendar”. We have used this to let people in a Cohort know of an optional impromptu session like drop-in GitHub help, or a screenshare-and-tell for example. The event must be in a public calendar for this to work.",

They require at least two team members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHistorical aside\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 we experimented having GitHub Clinics as stand-alone events between Cohort Calls 1 and 2, offering them twice, as well as the recording as part of team’s Seaside Chats. In some Cohorts it was difficult for participants to make extra time outside of the Cohort Calls, and it was extra scheduling for everyone. In 2022 we reinstated the GitHub Clinic into Cohort Call 2, and increased the number of Cohort Calls to 5.\n\n\n\n\n10.1 Overview\nJulie recorded videos of her teaching the GitHub Clinic to enable others to teach it. These are linked in the Openscapes Lesson Series book.\nDuring the Clinic, the Tech Host will make breakout groups, either based on their actual research team or as a random breakout group, depending on whether they attend with their team. We use the Cohort’s ParticipantsList spreadsheet to assist with identifying teams, and we may ask people to rename themselves in Zoom to identify their team.\nThe Facilitator leads the agenda, and Teacher talks through the slides and screenshares (more recently we do not screenshare slides after Cohort Call 1; we do screenshare the live demos in the GitHub Clinic).\nTeam members can also circulate in the breakout rooms to check in, help, and share.\nPreparing for the GitHub Clinic involves:\n\ntechnical setup with kyber\nreviewing the slides and live demos\n\n\n\n10.2 Technical setup with kyber\nTo set up GitHub Clinics, we recommend using the kyber R package created by Sean Kross. kyber automates adding participants’ GitHub usernames to a Team that can write to the GitHub repo, and creates a set of markdown files such that each person has their own name.md to play around in. You can also do this “by hand” at github.com and copy-paste files from other cohorts if you prefer (we did this for the first few Champions cohorts!). Also, setting up with GitHub Clinic is not Openscapes-specific so you don’t need to be leading an Openscapes event to use kyber!\nBefore the GitHub Clinic, we ask people to create a GitHub account and share their username with us - as part of their task following the previous Cohort Call. 1-2 days before the Clinic we email a reminder for folks to share their username with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample email for GitHub username reminder\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject: Openscapes - your GitHub username for Call 02\nHi All,\nWe’re looking forward to the GitHub Clinic on Wednesday for Cohort Call 02! We will be adding you all to a [year-cohort-name-cohort] GitHub Team so that you can participate. Please share your GitHub username today if possible.\nAdd your GitHub username to the Cohort_ParticipantList [ year-cohort-name ] spreadsheet in our Cohort Folder, column F. Creating a GitHub account for the first time? Here’s some username advice.\nNo prior knowledge needed for the Clinic!\nCheers, Stef\n\n\n\nFrom RStudio, within the Cohort repository (example 2022-noaa-afsc), follow kyber Github Clinic instructions. Make sure you pull before starting in case there are any updates you don’t have locally. You might be prompted to install some other R packages called by kyber.\nTo prepare for the Clinic, we do the following:\n\nAdd all usernames with member privileges to a GitHub Team titled like 2022-noaa-afsc-cohort\nGive the Team access to the Cohort repo\nCreate each person’s name.md files",

Many groups have their own internal process however, and that’s great.\n\n\nEmail to confirm team leads\nWhen teams have nominated themselves, we send an email to potential team leads with more details and ask them to reply cc’ing their teams and scheduling 1:1 intro calls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email welcome to selected PIs\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉\nDear [PI],\nThank you for nominating your team to participate in the FDD Openscapes Champions Cohort! We are excited for you to be a part of the cohort; this email is your official acceptance. To confirm you’re still able to participate, please:\n\nBook a 30-minute intro call on August 27 or 30 [link to Google Cal booking page] – or suggest other times if that is not possible, preferably September 10. These are short intro calls with Openscapes and team leads to start getting to know each other, share more details about the Champions Program, learn about the team, how they work, their goals for the Cohort, and answer any questions.\nRespond to this email, cc’ing your team members (up to 4 others). We will then add you and your team to Google Calendar invites for all 4 Cohort Calls.\n\nOur cohort page details the dates and times, as well as some background about what to expect, Openscapes, and FDD. We will also email the full cohort prior to the Aug 29 start date.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions! We’re looking forward to working and learning with you.\nCheers,\nJulie Lowndes, Openscapes\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail to confirm individuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email welcome to selected NMFS individuals\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Welcome to the NMFS Openscapes Champions Cohort 🎉\nHello All,\nWe are so excited to welcome you to the 2022 SEFSC Openscapes Champions Cohort! Our first Cohort Call is the first week of October and we wanted to share some information with you. Many thanks to Erica Rule for coordination and support in creating this opportunity, and to Adyan Rios and Molly Stevens who are co-leading this Cohort. This is one of four NMFS Openscapes Cohorts happening concurrently this Fall and we’ll create some opportunities for you to connect. \nThe Openscapes Champions Program is designed for you to all participate actively with your team and across teams in the Cohort, so please come prepared to engage with your colleagues. Within your team and across teams we have a mix of backgrounds, technical/coding/data experience, responsibilities, and more – this is intentional. You are all welcome here and provide value to our Cohort; there are no technical prerequisites to participate. \nPreparing for our Cohort. This week, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites for our 5 Cohort Calls. If you have not received these invites, please let us know.\n\nDates: October 4, 18, November 1, 15, 29\nTimes: 10:00am - 11:30am PT\nLocation: Remotely, via Zoom (link will be added to Calendar invites)\n\nBook a 30-minute intro call the week of Sept 26 – or suggest other times if that is not possible. These optional “1:1’s” are a chance for your team to meet the Openscapes team, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions. Please discuss with your team and book a time (one time per team).\nRead before our first callLowndes et al 2017: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools.\n\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by ourCode of Conduct. We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this cohort more accessible to you.\nWill be recording all Cohort Calls. They will be available for you if you miss a meeting or to use as a reference, and to help us improve the program, but not shared publicly. If you have any concerns about being recorded, please let us know. We will also have live transcripts. \n“Seaside Chats”: In the alternating weeks when we do not meet as a cohort, your task will be to meet as a team to further discuss and apply what we learn to your work. We call these meetings “Seaside Chats” and suggest you schedule them with your team now; people usually schedule these as 60-min meetings but you can make them whatever length you want. \nOptional “Coworking” sessions: times to implement what we’ve learned during Cohort Calls, where we work on our own projects at the same time together. Sometimes, this means quiet work with check-ins to break up the time, be accountable for, and get feedback on focused work, and sometimes this involves breakout rooms and screensharing to plan and problem solve. We’ll send Google Calendar invitations after our first Cohort Call.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of it; we have an exciting group assembled and we’re looking forward to getting to know all of you and strengthening relationships within the Cohort.\nCheers,\nJulie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland (Openscapes)\nEli Holmes (NWFSC)\n\n\n\n\nEmail to decline\nDeclining nominees is the worst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email to decline nominees\n\n\n\n\n\nDear NAME,\nThank you for nominating your team to participate in the Openscapes Champions CS&S Cohort; we appreciate your interest in learning with us. This was our first open call and we had more interest than we expected, and have not been able to accept all of the great teams that applied. Unfortunately, this means that we are not able to include you in our CS&S cohort.\nWe will be looking to offer more opportunities like this one as we grow Openscapes as a program, and invite you to stay tuned through our (infrequent) newsletter and via Mastodon @openscapes@fosstodon.org. There are also upcoming virtual opportunities at NCEAS, including through the Reproducible Research Techniques for Synthesis course in July.\nCheers,\nJulie Lowndes and Erin Robinson\nCo-Directors, Openscapes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam setup and calendaring\nHere’s the process as the PIs confirm with their teams:\n\nAdd to OpenscapesParticipants [ 2021-fdd ]\nAdd team leads and members to the Cohort Calls and optional Coworking sessions on the OpenscapesEvents Google Calendar. Use same Zoom link for both invites.\nReply all welcome email to team members with confirmation (example text below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample text for Google Calendar invites\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s helpful to add “Openscapes” as the first word in title of Calendar invite to distinguish it from many other invites in people’s calendars.\n\nOpenscapes Coworking - Fred Hutch Champions Cohort\ndescription text: We set up an hour for Coworking in between Cohort Calls; these are optional times where folks can work on their own things but also share and ask questions. Julie and Stef will be there to answer questions. Want to have your Team Seaside Chat at this time?

This is a way for us to get to know each other and to learn more about their team’s needs. We hold these ~3 weeks before the start of the cohort.\nSchedule these calls in 2 half-day blocks of time to fit different time zones. Create ~10 separate Google calendar items with 25-minute meetings, each with a unique zoom link. For each meeting, click the 3-dots &gt; publish &gt; copy link; add list of times & their links to the Welcome email, inviting individuals and team leads to select a time and invite their team members.\nNote: We do not use a Google Calendar Appointment Schedule for these 1:1’s because once a person books a meeting, it is not available to others. For large groups like NMFS Openscapes with 3 concurrent cohorts, we want multiple people and teams to be able to join the same welcome call.\nExcerpt from welcome email:\n(Optional) Join a 25-minute welcome call Sep 24 or 25 – These optional calls are a chance for you to meet the Openscapes team and other NMFS colleagues in small groups, learn more about what to expect, start thinking about your goals, and ask any questions.

Through the Champions Program we help researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct collaborative data-intensive science. Openscapes Champions is not a typical workshop — its cohort-based remote sessions for teams introduces concepts and workflows, facilitates teams to talk about problems, then go and solve them with accountability and support. It is a remote-by-design program, launched in 2019, and this is our 20th Cohort! Our Cohort is sponsored by Fred Hutch Data Science Lab, with Sean Kross and Monica Gerber supporting us and being a direct link between your needs and solutions at Fred Hutch.\nBefore August 29, please:\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites with Zoom links for our 5 Cohort Calls starting August 29 as well as optional Coworking sessions in the weeks between Cohort Calls.

For example, Dr. Jessica Couture contributed a new slide deck on metadata and presented this during the data strategies for future us lesson. Most of our guest teachers are Champions from previous cohorts (Jessica is a Champion from the 2019-inaugural cohort), and we are able to offer an honorarium for their time and expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject: Invitation as guest teacher in Openscapes\nHi [ potential guest teacher],\nHow are you? I hope you’ve had a break this summer and are doing ok with everything going on.\nOpenscapes has a few Champions cohorts we’re leading this fall, including one with researchers using fisheries dependent data in the US Northeast coordinated by Gavin Fay, Andy Jones, and Rachel Baum (here’s the cohort page).\nWe wanted to invite you as a guest teacher at one of these Cohort Calls for 20-25 minutes, presenting ~12 mins of slides and leading the following discussion (likely breakout groups and then group discussion). We’re thinking of you joining the second call and presenting about data strategies for future us, or the third and presenting about coding strategies for future us. You could either present from our existing slide decks, or present something on-theme from your work, and we can help you with the format and timing. Cohort Calls 2 & 3 are on October 1 & 15 from 12-1:30pm ET (exact time TBD but you’re welcome to just attend for your part). We are able to offer an honorarium as well.\nWe’re excited to hear your ideas, and if this isn’t the right thing now to think about if there’s another way we can involve you in the future if you’d like. We’d love to chat with you about it in any case, would you be able to suggest a few times for a 30-minute call?\nCheers,\nJulie and Erin\n\n\n\nAnd some follow up advice to help strategize preparing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email advice to guest teacher\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m following up on our conversation about your Data Strategies lesson for the CA Water Boards Openscapes Cohort. Here’s my advice brain-dump ;-) \nThe most important point is that you don’t need to make up new material or create an activity. We teach these lessons from our existing slide deck. Julie taught from this deck to the previous Water Boards Cohort and I did the same for another cohort. The speaker notes have some guiding language. We try to basically say what’s on the slides and we pepper them (within the time limit) with personal examples or anecdotes. \nTheData Strategies page in our Openscapes Champions Lesson Series, has a narrative that essentially follows the slides. Near the top of that page is a link to a recording of Ileana Fenwick teaching from the same slide deck. The first time I prepared to give that lesson (the only time so far), I started by watching Ileana’s recording and reading the couple of papers/ blog posts in the slides. Tip: when a slide has a list of 10 tips, you don’t need to say them all. You might say “this paper gives 10 tips for … . I want to highlight 3”. Then I said the tip and gave an example of how I’ve used it in my work. That’s the way you get to make the same slide deck be relatable and allow you to share your own knowledge and experiences.\nThe Water Boards sessions are in Microsoft Teams. There are ~ 20 folks. When teaching, you don’t share your screen - people follow along by clicking through the slide deck themselves - that means it’s easier to use speaker notes if you like to do that. Anna Holder, the lead, is such a warm facilitator with a great sense of humour that shows through. She makes for a really positive teaching experience. \nLooking forward to seeing you soon,\nStef\n\n\n\nFollowup email the week before:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email to guest teacher: week prior\n\n\n\n\n\nHi Emily and Chanté,\nWe’re excited about your guest teaching and wanted to check in about it. We’ve had a good first week and two GitHub Clinics and people are excited to learn from how you both work!\nI’ve just shared our [draft Agenda] for this second Cohort Call on October 1, with Emily planned for 11:45-12:20. Would you be able to share your plan by Sept 30 and we can iterate? We can work with you and iterate the discussion prompts following your slides if you’d like, and whether it would make most sense to have more of a group discussion rather than breakouts.\nHow does all this sound? Happy to meet to chat about it/review together if you have questions, or continue discussions by email.\nThank you!\nCheers,\nJulie",

Quarto makes collaborating to create technical documentation streamlined because we work in plain text documents that can have executable code (Python, R) and are rendered using Jupyter and Knitr engines.\nWhat is Quarto? Quarto builds from what RStudio learned from RMarkdown but enables different engines (Jupyter and knitr). It is both a Command Line Tool and R package. .qmd is a new filetype like .Rmd — meaning it’s a text file but coupled with an engine can execute code and be rendered as html, pdf, word, and beyond — but for other languages like Python. Quarto can convert .ipynb files to and from .md and .qmd easily so you can develop and publish with collaborators that have different workflows. Once the book is “served” locally, .md files auto-update as you edit, and files with executable code can be rendered individually, and the behavior of different code chunks can be controlled and cached.\n(Note: with Quarto, e-books and websites are very similarly structured, with e-books being set up for numbered chapters and references and websites set up for higher number of pages and organization. We can talk about our book as a book even as we explore whether book/website better suits our needs. This is assigned in _quarto.yml, as we’ll explore later).",

The author, a researcher in positive psychology and diversity and inclusion, argues that to bring advocates and critics of diversity together, leaders must orient around a broader goal: creating the conditions for all workers to flourish. Given the high rates of disengagement and burnout, especially for those in historically marginalized groups, companies need a new approach. The author argues for fostering four freedoms at work: the freedom to be, the freedom to become, the freedom to fade, and the freedom to fail. Currently the four are unevenly distributed, but interventions such as encouraging individual allyship, implementing strengths-based development programs, and enabling flexible work can make organizations safer and more welcoming for all.”",

While often the focus is on data, publications, code, software developers, and researchers, the transition to Open involves investment across agencies and organizations of all kinds. One critical and often-overlooked part of transitioning to Open is that it requires support from managers and leadership, who do not need to be Open science experts but who can imagine the return on investment and support their teams through time and resources to learn new skills and technologies, take risks, and even fail through the process. In this paper we describe our work developing the Openscapes Flywheel with NASA Earth science data centers, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. We offer three practical ways managers can support their teams and grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations: (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through, investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement. Together these lessons create kinder and more inclusive organizations that are more resilient as data volumes increase and software evolve, and dispel the hero myth of science. Engaging, empowering and amplifying efforts to support people while modernizing our workforce is the way that we will meet the world’s greatest challenges, from climate change to social justice to democracy. We can already see how working this way increases inclusion, reproducibility, and resilience within and across government, academic, and non-profit organizations, and are hopeful for what we can do together in growing this movement.",

We are doing this working with NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) over three years by: Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community Empowering science teams through the Champions program Scaling the Champions program with DAAC Mentors\nIn Year 1 we focused on item (1) Developing a cross-DAAC Mentor community through developing the DAAC Mentors program, leading the DAAC Mentors program, and community engagement within NASA and beyond. These activities and products are detailed below.\nIn Year 1 we adapted our plans for items (2,3) the Champions program to better align with timelines for NASA Earthdata in the cloud, as well as for further development in the Mentors community and investment in Cloud curriculum (e.g. Earthdata Cloud Cookbook and 2021 Cloud Hackathon). We advertised for a Champions Cohort for summer 2021 but shifted to March 2022 instead. We describe preparations for this in more detail below and the Cohort itself will be detailed in Year 2.\nAppendix 2 are slides from a 10-min presentation at the ESIP Winter meeting (January 2022) summarizing and visualizing some of these efforts.\n\n\nYear 2 Summary, 2022\nNASA Openscapes is a 3-year effort to grow a cross-DAAC Mentor community supporting Open NASA Earth Science in the Cloud. We approach this work as movement building, and developed the Openscapes Flywheel with NASA Earth science data centers, using the concept where transformations occur from relentlessly pushing a giant, heavy flywheel that builds momentum over time. The Flywheel supports teams across NASA DAACs to to grow morale and technical capacity across their organizations by (1) Engage bright spots, through welcoming them and creating space and place; (2) Empower a learning culture through investing in learning and trust and working openly (3) Amplify Open science leaders, through leveraging the common and inspiring the bigger movement (Robinson & Lowndes 2022). Through this work, some highlights of impact to date: (1 Engage): 7 DAACs participating (NSIDC, PO.DAAC, LP DAAC, GES DISC, ASDC, ASF, ORNL); have a JupyterHub and Notebook-Quarto-GitHub workflow for documentation and publishing; have co-created a consistent set of tutorials, teaching style, and mindset; co-led the 2021 Cloud Hackathon and 2022 Champions program; have documented our work through the Flywheel pub and Approach Guide; and given many invited talks & keynotes. (2 Empower): Mentors have led 10 Workshops: internal with DAAC staff and external with researchers; developed the Earthdata Cloud Cookbook; Reused tutorials, slides, graphics and facilitation and open practices; were more aware cross-DAAC, less recreating; from user feedback developed Cheatsheets and the earthaccess python library; wrote the Value of Hosted JupyterHubs (White paper RFI); Collaborating on Hackweeks, 2i2c cont'd access after workshops. (3 Amplify): Mentors are amplifying across-DAACs and beyond: Career advancement & bringing mindset to new places; Speaking up in other meetings (User Needs TIM, TRAIN, Cloud Playground); Connecting & consulting based on experiences - Pathfinder for 2i2c, comparing w/ SMCE; AWS; Engaging beyond (Pangeo Forge, Ladies of Landsat, pyOpenSci).\nFrom one Mentor, Cassandra Nickles (PO.DAAC):\n\nOpenscapes has created a collaborative environment for DAAC staff to collectively support open science initiatives for NASA Earthdata users. It enables us to work more openly with other DAACs toward our common goal of making the Earthdata ecosystem more accessible and inclusive. We've developed awesome material to help Earthdata users such asworkflow cheatsheets, a python package (earthaccess), and data recipes hosted in the cross-DAACNASA Earthdata Cloud Cookbook. Perhaps just as important as what we've done however, are mindsets we've grown into along the way. It's okay to share imperfect works in progress. The virtual environment can be conducive to laughter and connection. Ideas are not too big or too small to share. We are better at dreaming and implementing the future together.",

The submission provides a recommendation for NASA to recognize easy, accessible, and inclusive cloud access as a Core Service to support the agency’s Open Source Science Initiative.\nThe following Request for Information (RFI) presents collective thoughts of the NASA Openscapes mentor community. NASA Openscapes, co-facilitated by Erin Robinson and Julia Stewart Lowndes, is a space where members from seven NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) come together to collaborate. This cross-DAAC mentor community develops resources, teaches, and listens to feedback from NASA Earthdata end users on a regular basis. NASA has provided data freely through the DAACs for decades, enabling researchers to make significant contributions to understanding our planet that would not have been possible otherwise. As Earthdata migrates to the cloud, we at the DAACs have been positioned to help facilitate data ease of access for end users within this cloud infrastructure. We are uniquely familiar with the broader challenges our data end users face as they transition their workflows to the cloud and hope to share our experiences and recommendations as NASA moves to inclusively support open science practices in the cloud framework.",

    "section": "Coaching skills",
    "text": "Coaching skills\nThe 2025 Openscapes Mentor-Coach cohort was a 5-part series where we developed coaching skills that can help us as professionals – skills like listening rather than solutioneering, asking open-ended questions that empower people to find their own agency and meet their needs. We practiced skills throughout through activities around values, future self, and asking icebreaker questions (what kind of egg would you be, describe yourself with the weather) to help people describe their needs when they may not have the language for it. Distinguishing when we’re listening as mentors and when we’re listening as coaches is important, because it determines how we will respond as early adopters who may not know the answer to the question – think cloud computing, how to store increasingly large data, how to give hard feedback to a superior, and how to ask for help in a culture built on competition and the myth of the lone genius. Developing these coach listening skills, including what questions to ask, has helped us help others better (and notice and avoid solutioneering!). It’s also helped us feel less overwhelmed as we learn that it’s okay to not always have the answer!\nSome skills we learned: Powerful questions and listening as coaches.\n\nNotes on powerful questions\nPowerful questions that Openscapes mentors use as part of our coaching skills. We use these questions as tools as we support colleagues learning new skills to make our work more collaborative, reproducible, and transparent.\nWhat do we mean by a “powerful question”? It’s a short question that can open up a really powerful conversation. It’s open-ended, usually starts with the word “What”, ideally is 5 words or less, and can’t be answered by yes or no. What feels like success to you? What’s in the way? What, if anything, is going unsaid? Which of your core values is being messed with?\nSee the Powerful Questions Card Deck. We hope you are able to use these for yourself and/or in Seaside Chats/Coworking with others, while strengthening your skills.\n\n\nNotes on listening\nHow we listen differs whether we are in mentor-mode or coach-mode:\n\nWhen we listen as mentors, we’re trying to understand where our expertise can help someone solve a problem.\nWhen we’re listening as coaches, we’re trying to help the other person define their problem, and tap into their own wisdom to find their solution, likely outside of our domain expertise.\n\nMore in-depth on this: 3 levels of listening.\n\nL1: about ourself (not really listening);\nL2: focus on the other person;\nL3: focus on the other person + environment around us.\n\nHow this shows up for our work as Mentors:\n\nL1: listen like a mentor, find where our expertise fits to share back\nL2: listen like a coach, to help them find/define/solve their own problem. Not solutioneering.\nL3: listen like a coach, sensing the energy. Empathy. What you pick up other than what they are saying.\n\nCredit to Tara Robertson for leading some Openscapes Mentors in “Mentoring with a Coach Approach” Series.

We’re adding the content here for future us to adapt and reuse.\n\nPurpose: Onboarding to how we work, while getting specific tasks done to prepare for a Champions Cohort. We’re hoping the group will have complementing motivations to learn/reuse.\nProcess: 4 Calls: Call 1 to be a kickoff conversation to share our overall approach, context, and get to know everyone’s needs/motivations. Calls 2-4 will be what we call “coworking” - Stef will screenshare and Stef and Julie will talk through the tech and tasks we get done live that day, and we can learn together. We can schedule a check-in call after the cohort.\nOutcomes: People learn how we work and have a sense of how this applies to their work, and everything is set for our spring Champions Cohorts for NASA Earthdata and EPA researchers.\n\n\nLesson Content\nThe Google doc HowWeWork_ChampionsSetup_2024 [ public ] has Agendas for the 4 sessions.\nPlanning/Communication section at bottom of the doc has text of emails sent to invitees.\nRecordings of sessions e.g. HowWeWork_ChampionsSetup_Coworking-01_2024, are in the OpenscapesCohortPlanning folder.",

We decided on a curriculum, which they followed through a weekly cadence of lessons. We had weekly “Help Desk” sessions on Wednesdays, and set up a Google Space for chat and Q&A. Each Monday morning we sent an email with the tasks and information needed for the week.\nExpected time commitment: Weekly for 3 months: 2-hour chunks of learning time, plus optional 1 hour of support from a “help desk” and coworking.\n\nParticipant Selection & Cohort Administration\nWe asked NMFS Mentors to share the opportunities with their colleagues:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email sent to mentors to promote the Data Academy\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Mentors!\nPlease share with your colleagues about the upcoming NMFS Openscapes Data Academy for R programming skill-building for NOAA Fisheries. FTEs and Affiliates from any Fisheries office are welcome to sign up and there is no cost to staff or your center/office. The Data Academy is being led by Openscapes as part of the Fisheries Data Modernization Strategy.\nWhat: You will learn R for data science through lessons on the dataquest.io platform. The Data Academy is asynchronous so you can complete the lessons on your own schedule each week, and also cohort-based so you’ll get to know your colleagues and have accountability. The Openscapes team will provide support through weekly synchronous help desk hours and coworking and a dedicated Google Space for help and collaboration with other learners. A training certificate will be issued for each course completed. During the Data Academy, you will have access to the full dataquest.io library of courses in addition to the R Curriculum.\nCurriculum: https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/data-academy.html#curriculum\nExpected time commitment: Weekly for 3 months: 2-hour chunks of learning time, plus 1 hour of optional support from a “help desk” and coworking.\nWhen: April 14 - June 17, 2025.\n\nMondays: Week’s lesson reminder received via email. Complete lessons on your own schedule.\n\nWednesdays: Help desk and coworking with the Openscapes team alongside other participants (Optional, via Zoom)\n\nWho: FTEs and Affiliates from any Fisheries office, are welcome to sign up. The 40 available spots will be distributed across centers and offices.\nWhat’s the minimum I need to know? Absolute beginners are encouraged to apply. People should be comfortable working with data in other contexts (e.g., spreadsheets, databases, GIS, other languages such as Python, Matlab, etc.).\nCost: Free. There is no cost to staff or your center/office. This opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes.\nHow to apply: If you’re interested in participating, please add yourself to the interest sheet: DataAcademy_Interest_Spring2025 [ nmfs-openscapes ]. Deadline to apply is close of business, March 24. Selected applicants will be notified April 1. The 40 available spots will be distributed across centers and offices. Participants will be selected by the Openscapes team with input from NMFS Open Science staff and NMFS Openscapes Mentors. If people decline their offer to participate, we will select people from the waitlist, prioritizing people from the same division.\nFrequently asked questions and details of the curriculum are listed on the NMFS Openscapes Data Academy page.\nWhat is Openscapes? Since 2020, Openscapes has helped NOAA Fisheries teams and individuals make substantial progress on difficult workflow transformation goals, such as transitioning to new cloud computing or data storage workflows, improving team awareness and collaboration, and automating (scripting) large data-heavy reports. They have been recognized by the White House, NASA, NIH, California EPA, Posit, Mozilla, and others for their work supporting science teams transitioning to open science and cloud workflows. This opportunity is supported through the “Fully Enable Open Science” initiative in the Fisheries Modernization Strategy. This initiative is part of our NOAA Fisheries Data Strategy and led by the Office of Science and Technology.\nPlease share this opportunity with your colleagues across NOAA Fisheries! These details are also listed here: https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/data-academy.\nCheers,\nStefanie Butland, Julie Lowndes, Andy Teucher, Openscapes\nEli Holmes, Jon Peake, NMFS Open Science & NMFS Openscapes\n\n\n\nPeople who were interested in participating signed up in the interest sheet. In signing up, participants wrote their learning goals, from which we attempted to infer their experience level (1 = true beginner, 2 = uncertain, 3 = more experienced). We then asked them to return to the spreadsheet and confirm their experience level, and/or optionally remove themselves from consideration for the first cohort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEmail sent to participants to confirm experience level\n\n\n\n\n\nHi All!\nWe’re thrilled to see your interest in increasing your R skills and that &gt;150 people have applied to participate in our first NMFS Openscapes Data Academy! With only 40 spots available at a time, we have decided to focus Cohort 1 this spring for “true R beginners” with little or no coding experience and hold 3 additional cohorts in the next 12 months for other R learners. The Data Academy cohorts 2025 doc outlines the plan for each cohort.\nNow we need your help to self-assess so we can select 40 “true beginners” for Cohort 1. Please review your Cohort assignment (inferred skill level) in DataAcademy_Interest_Spring2025 [ nmfs-openscapes ]; we currently have &gt;40 applicants labeled as Cohort 1. Assignments were based on your responses to “briefly describe your learning goals for the data academy”, then we (Julie, Andy, Stef, Eli, Jon) assigned cohorts. Have we mis-assigned your skill level? Are you no longer able to commit to ~3 hours a week from April 14 - July 17, 2025 and need to opt out? Please indicate any changes in the spreadsheet COLUMN G and confirm you have reviewed it in COLUMN H by April 7 close of business. After that, we will distribute the 40 available spots across centers and offices and email Cohort 1 with next steps.\nFolks who are not participating in a current cohort can get great support from the NMFS Open Science Help Desk & R User Group. Check out the NMFS Open Science Training page for these and other opportunities.\nThank you all for your enthusiasm for this opportunity, and working with us to provide it to as many folks as possible. We will check in with dates of Cohorts 2-4 as we get closer to them, so you don’t need to commit yet.\nCheers,\nStefanie Butland, Andy Teucher, Julie Lowndes, Openscapes\nEli Holmes, Jon Peake, NMFS Open Science\n\n\n\nThe initial plan was to run one cohort of 40 people, but decided to run the equivalent of two cohorts simultaneously, for a total for 80 people.\nWe selected all applicants who confirmed their experience as level-1, and chose level-2 applicants if they had confirmed their level, and if their learning goals included clear planned use - enough to complete a cohort of 80 people.\nPeople who were selected were added to a data-academy Google Group in Openscapes Google Workspace. This Google Group was used for sending mass emails to particpants.\nParticpants were also added to a NOAA Google Chat Space, for asynchronous help and cooperative learning.\n\n\nPre-cohort Engagement\nApplicants who were selected were sent this email:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample email to selected participants\n\n\n\n\n\nHello All,\nWe are excited to welcome you to the 2025 NMFS Openscapes Data Academy – our first lessons begin next week on Monday April 14! Our first cohort for R beginners will be supported with weekly emails, synchronous help desk support from the Openscapes team, and help in a dedicated Google Space. Many thanks to NMFS Openscapes Mentors and NMFS Open Science Team, who have helped shape and amplify this opportunity.\nWe are doubling our level-1 R beginners cohort size to 80 people to meet the demand from over 150 signups. Thank you for helping self-assess your skill level; we selected all 70 level-1 folks plus 10 level-2 people, with level-2 folks selected to achieve representation across centers and offices.\nOn April 9-10 you will be added to the dataquest.io platform with your NOAA email. Then, we will follow a weekly cadence, April 14 - July 17 (we will share Google Calendar invites via a Google Group, so you will see a few emails as we set that all up):\n\nMondays: Week’s lesson reminder received via email. Complete the lesson on your own schedule.\n\nWednesdays: Help desk and coworking with the Openscapes team and data academy colleagues (Optional, via Zoom). Hours will alternate between 1-2pm PT (starting April 16th), and 12-1pm PT (starting April 23).\n\nAction items.\n\nIf you can no longer actively participate, please reply immediately to this email so we can give your spot to another R beginner. DataAcademy_Interest_Spring2025 [ nmfs-openscapes ] lists who else will be participating alongside you.\n\nCheck that you’ve received Google Calendar invites for our weekly help desk sessions. If you have not received these invites, please let us know. We will meet remotely via Zoom, which you can do from the browser without installing any software.\n\nAdditional Information.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct. We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this cohort more accessible to you.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions.

We will follow a weekly cadence, April 14 - July 11. We encourage everyone to be active in the Cohort as you are able to; peer-learning and peer-teaching is an incredibly effective way to understand and solidify what you’re learning in the DataQuest platform\n\nMondays: Week’s lesson reminder received via email. Complete the lesson(s) on your own schedule.\n\nWednesdays: Help desk and coworking with the Openscapes team and data academy colleagues (Optional, via Zoom). Hours will alternate between 1-2pm PT (starting April 16th), and 12-1pm PT (starting April 23).\n\nAsynchronous: Asking questions and learning from each other in the Google Space.\n\nOver the course of the next 13 weeks we will be completing two “Skills Paths” in the DataQuest platform:\n\nR Basics for Data Analysis\n\nData Visualization with R\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if there is anything we can do to help you throughout the cohort, as we want to make this opportunity most effective for you. Thank you for being a part of this; we’re looking forward to continuing skillbuilding and workforce development across NOAA Fisheries with you.\nCheers,\nAndy Teucher, Ileana Fenwick, Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland (Openscapes)\nEli Holmes, Jon Peake (NMFS Open Science)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEmail for participants - Week 2:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: All 80 participants\nFrom: Andy\nCc: Ileana, Julie, Stef\nSubject: Week 2 – NMFS Openscapes Data Academy!\nHello, and welcome to Week 2 of the 2025 NMFS Openscapes Data Academy!\nThis week (April 21-25)\n\nCurriculum goals: Lesson 3 and 4 of Introduction to Data Analysis in R\n\nLesson 3: Logical Expressions in R\n\nLesson 4: Data Manipulation with R: Basics\n\n\nHelp Desk :\n\nWednesday April 23, 12-1pm PT. https://zoom.us/j/91025564590\n\nOngoing asynchronous discussion in our Google Space\n\nWe had a fun and productive Help Desk session last week, with a small but very engaged group of learners. You can see our collaborative notes document here - we will add to this each week when we meet.\nAction items:\n\nInstall R and RStudio on your computer by week 3 (next week). We know that each center has a different process for software installation so please try to action this as soon as you are able. There was a short discussion about it in our Google Space last week.\n\nPlease try to follow the learning schedule we are suggesting as much as possible. Learning in a cohort will be more enjoyable and productive than going it alone, and it will get harder to catch up as time goes on and the lessons get more complex. That said, we understand that everyone is dealing with a lot right now, so please let us know if there is anything we can do to help make your learning journey more manageable.\n\nUpdate: Dataquest have created a custom Learning Path for us, consisting of R Basics for Data Analysis, and Data Visualization with R. You don’t need to action anything here; you have been automatically enrolled. It is the same curriculum we have been following, and your completed lessons will apply to all applicable paths, including this new one.\nHave a great week, and we’d love to see you in the Help Desk session on Wednesday if you would like to join us!\nCheers,\nAndy Teucher, Ileana Fenwick, Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEmail for participants - Week 3:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo: All 80 participants\nFrom: Andy\nCc: Ileana, Julie, Stef\nSubject: Week 3 – NMFS Openscapes Data Academy!\nHello, and welcome to Week 3 of the 2025 NMFS Openscapes Data Academy!\nThis week (April 21-25)\n\nCurriculum goals: Last lesson of Introduction to Data Analysis in R, and first lesson of Data Structures in R:\n\nLesson 5 of Introduction to Data Analysis in R: Project: Install RStudio\n\nLesson 1 of Data Structures in R: Vectors in R\n\n\nHelp Desk :\n\nWednesday April 30, 1-2pm PT. https://zoom.us/j/91025564590\n\nOngoing asynchronous discussion in our Google Space\n\nHelp Desk sessions remain small so far, so lots of space to chat and ask questions if you want to join us!

It may take you a bit more time as you actively practice and build on the skills we have learned so far, and that’s okay. There are many ways to get help if you need it! You can post in the Google Space so everyone can benefit from the conversation, and please do come to the Help Desk on Wednesday if you can. People have had good luck with the Chandra AI assistant in the dataquest platform, and dataquest links to their version of the solution in the last page of the lesson. I have also put my version on GitHub.\nHave a great week, and we’d love to see you in the Help Desk session on Wednesday if you would like to join us! This week and in the future, we’ll be joined in our Help Desk sessions by the amazing Cassie Nickles, so we will have lots of support to help answer your questions and dig into any issues.\nCheers,\nAndy Teucher, Ileana Fenwick, Cassie Nickles, Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland\nPS:\nWe had originally planned to have two lessons this week, but since the guided project is a fairly heavy task and it’s a short week due to the holiday, we have decided to push the first lesson of Control Flow, Iterations, and Functions to next week.

Whether you’ve completed one course or five, you’ve gained valuable skills along the way. With just 4 weeks remaining in our program, now’s the perfect time to push toward earning your next certificate!\nHere’s what’s available to you:\nIndividual Course Certificates - Complete any of the courses in the curriculum to earn a certificate for that specific course.\nPath Certificates - Finish an entire learning path (R Basics for Data Analysis OR Data Visualization with R) to earn a comprehensive path certificate that showcases your complete skill set in that area. Complete both of these paths and you will have completed our custom “Introduction to R and Data Visualization” path.\nHow to claim your certificates: Once you complete a course or path, Dataquest automatically generates your certificate. You can see what certificates you have earned by clicking on your profile in the top right, and then click “Profile” - you can download them all at the bottom of the page!\nYour access continues until August 18th. Whether you’re close to finishing a course or ready to complete an entire path, every certificate you earn represents real progress in your data journey.\nNeed help getting to the finish line? Join us at the Wednesday Help Desk - we’re here to help you navigate any challenges and make sure you get the certificates you’re working toward.\nYou’ve already invested so much time and effort, and the certificates are a nice way to show it!\nCheers,\nAndy Teucher, Ileana Fenwick, Cassie Nickles, Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Space\nWe created a Google Space in the NMFS organization, and used it for asynchronous chat and help. We posted reminders about the Help Desk sessions and other announcements, and links to Help Desk notes and recording after the sessions. Participants used it to ask and answer questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOpening message in Google Space\n\n\n\n\n\nHi everyone, welcome to the NMFS Data Academy for R!\nWe hope you’ll use this space to ask and answer questions, and chat about what we’re learning - for example, where it might be applicable to your work, what it’s inspired you to think about, or even question when and how it might be relevant. Ileana Fenwick and I are also here to answer your questions, and to listen to your feedback about how it is going. I’m really looking forward to working with all of you!\n\n\n\nNext time we should give more tips about using markdown code formatting in the Google Space:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCode formatting message\n\n\n\n\n\nTo format code in chat here, you can use special code formatting: For inline code, surround the code with single backticks (eg., `character`). For code blocks, you surround it with \"fences\" of three backticks, or in the formatting toolbar click the \"code block\" button to insert a code block.\n\n```\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nread_csv(\"file.csv\")\n```\n\n(This is markdown formatting that is commonly used to write code in forums like this, here is GitHub's instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Desk\nWe ran a weekly 1-hour help desk session on Wednesdays, alternating 12-1 pm and 1-2 pm PT. These time slots were chose to accomadate time zones from Alasaka to Eastern. We received comments that Wedndesdays weren’t ideal as it was often too early in the week and people were not able to progress far enough to have questions ready.\nStefanie ran the logistics of the Help Desk sessions, and there were usually at least two, often three, helpers attending (Andy and/or Cassie and/or Ileana).\nHelp Desks began as informal, unstructured Q&A sessions, but evolved over the weeks. To try to make them more engaging, and entice people to come, we started choosing one or two lessons from the week and did a screen-sharing walkthrough in the main room. We had one breakout room for independent quiet work, one for active Q&A with a helper, and sometimes one breakout room with a second demo/walkthrough by a helper.\nAttendees signed in to the roll call, and added any specific questions/topics they wanted to discuss. We added a “silent journaling” section at the beginning, where people would write in the doc:\n\nSomething you feel good about learning\nA place where you are feeling stuck\n\nAttendees voted and/or discussed (depending on numbers) as to what the main room demo topic would be.\nIn general, we had between 3 and 10 attendees, with about 4-5 “regulars” who came to almost every session.\nWe recorded the demos in the main Zoom room, starting with Lesson 7, and shared them in a Google Drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExample Help Desk session agenda/coworking doc\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Month DD, 2025\nEdit description below for each week\nThis week (June 9 - 13).

That said, Ileana and I will be here to support you, so don’t feel as if you will be on your own!\nPlease have a look at the course website and let me know as soon as you can if you would like to join us.\nThanks so much,\nAndy Teucher, Ileana Fenwick, Julie Lowndes, Stefanie Butland\n\n\n\nThose that removed themselves from the course had this recorded in the participants selection sheet, as were those who were subsequently added.\n\n\n\nRemoving people from dataquest at the end of Spring Cohort\nAt the end of the Spring cohort, we removed dataquest.io licenses for participants, to free up licenses for the Fall 2025 Cohort:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEmail to those being removed from cohort 1:\n\n\n\n\n\nHello,\nWe want to sincerely thank all of you and applaud you for your time, effort, and dedication to the NMFS Openscapes Data Academy. You all put in a lot of effort in what we know is a challenging time, and hope you got what you needed out of the course. We had a great time meeting and working with many of you in the Help Desk sessions and in the Google Chat space.\nWe will be doing the switchover in dataquest.io today to allow a new cohort of learners to make use of the platform, and so you will no longer have access to all of the dataquest.io content. You will still have access to your certificates, and your progress will not be lost in case you come back to the platform.\nYou will keep your access to the Data Academy Google Chat space to continue the discussions and learning from one another.\nPlease reply to me (Andy) if you have any questions or concerns.\nThanks again,\nAndy, Ileana, Cassie, Stef",

    "text": "Fall 2025 Cohort\nThe Fall Cohort is designed for those with some R experience, and is intented to be more self-directed. Participants can choose their own learning paths based on their interests and needs, and/or choose to follow the same curriculum as those in the Spring cohort.\nParticipation in the Fall Cohort is tracked in the DataAcademy_Interest_Fall2025 [ nmfs-openscapes ] sheet.\nFall suggested curriculum schedule: NMFS Data Academy Curriculum Fall 2025 [data-academy-cohort].\nParticpants for the Fall cohort were selected from the waitlist of the Spring cohort.\nSupport from Openscapes for the Fall cohort is lighter - periodic reminders about the curriculum, and weekly 1-hour help-desk sessions, but not with full demos and only one helper (Andy). No prep time for helper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipEmail sent to wait list from Cohort 1:\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\nWe are reaching out because you previously expressed interest in the NMFS-Openscapes Data Academy but were not selected for the first cohort. Our second cohort will be starting in August, and we would love it if you are able to join us!\nWhat: You will learn R for data science through lessons on the dataquest.io platform. The Data Academy is asynchronous so you can complete the lessons on your own schedule each week, and also cohort-based so you’ll get to know and learn along with your colleagues. The Openscapes team will provide support through a weekly synchronous help desk and a dedicated Google Space for help and collaboration with other learners.\nSuggested Curriculum: https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/data-academy.html#curriculum\nDuring the Data Academy, you will have access to the full dataquest.io library of courses in addition to the R Curriculum. We expect many learners in this cohort may be more experienced, and so you are encouraged to find and complete the courses that best fit your learning needs. If you are a beginner, then the suggested curriculum is a great learning path for you. A training certificate will be issued for each course completed.\nParticipants in Cohort 2 will have less hands-on support than in Cohort 1. This is a peer group learning experience with the Google Space for questions.\nYou can also get great support from the NMFS Open Science Help Desk & R User Group. Check out the NMFS Open Science Training page for these and other opportunities, including weekly GitHub trainings, and Friday HackHours.\nExpected time commitment: Weekly for 15 weeks months: Approximately 2-hour chunks of learning time, plus 1 hour of optional support from a “help desk”.\nWhen: Aug 18 - Dec 19, 2025.\n\nComplete lessons on your own schedule.\n\nWednesdays: Help desk with the Openscapes team alongside other participants (Optional, via Zoom)\n\nCost: Free. There is no cost to staff or your center/office. This opportunity is supported by NOAA funding to Openscapes.\nHow to confirm your participation: If you’re interested in participating, please confirm in this Google sheet: DataAcademy_Interest_Fall2025 [ nmfs-openscapes ]. Choose “Yes” or “No” from the dropdown menu in the “Confirm Fall 2025” column (column H) beside your name. You may update your Skill Level in R in column G. The deadline to confirm is close of business, July 25. If you decline the offer to participate, we will select people from the waitlist, prioritizing people from the same division.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of this; we’re looking forward to continuing skillbuilding and strengthening relationships and open science across NMFS.\nCheers,\nStefanie Butland, Julie Lowndes, Andy Teucher, Openscapes\nEli Holmes, Jon Peake, NMFS Open Science & NMFS Openscapes\n\n\n\nThere were also several people from Cohort 1 who had their access extended or reinstated:\n\nThose who voluntarily removed themselves due to inability to commit to Cohort 1\nThose who made little progress in Cohort 1 due to unforseen circumstances\nA few very keen participants who wanted to keep learning and exploring more of the course catalogue.\n\nThe intention is to keep some spots free, and/or free up spots from people who had extended access, so that Fall NMFS Champions can use some licenses if they are keen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWelcome email to Cohort 2:\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!\nWe are excited to welcome you to the second cohort of the 2025 NMFS Openscapes Data Academy\nYou will learn R for data science through lessons on the dataquest.io platform. The Openscapes team will provide support through a weekly synchronous help desk and a dedicated Google Space for help and collaboration with other learners.\nDuring the Data Academy, you will have access to the full dataquest.io library of courses. We expect many learners in this cohort may be more experienced, so you are encouraged to find and complete the courses that best fit your learning needs. If you are a beginner, then the suggested curriculum is a great learning path for you. A training certificate will be issued for each course completed.\nSuggested Curriculum for beginners: https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/data-academy.html#curriculum (spreadsheet version: NMFS Data Academy Curriculum Fall 2025 [data-academy-cohort])\nYou will be added to the dataquest.io platform today (August 18) with your NOAA email. Once you have access, you will be able to start learning on your own schedule, either following the suggested curriculum or choosing your own learning path from any of the dataquest.io courses.\nWhen: Aug 18 - Dec 19, 2025.\n\nComplete lessons on your own schedule.\n\nWednesdays: Help desk with the Openscapes team alongside other participants (Optional, via Zoom). You will receive a Google Calendar invite for these meetings.\n\nIf you can no longer actively participate, please reply immediately to this email so we can give your spot to another learner.\nAll Openscapes events abide by our Code of Conduct. We are dedicated to providing a positive learning environment for all. Please let us know if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this cohort more accessible to you.\nPlease let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for being a part of this; we’re looking forward to continuing skillbuilding and strengthening relationships and open science across NMFS.\nCheers,\nAndy Teucher, Stefanie Butland, Julie Lowndes, Openscapes\nEli Holmes, Jon Peake, NMFS Open Science & NMFS Openscapes\n\n\n\n\nSpring - Fall Cohort switchover\n\nCreated new Google Group for Cohort 2 emails and calendar invites\nAndy asked Eli to add new people to Google Space. Partipacants from Cohort 1 remained in the Google Space.\nNew Google Calendar invites for Help Desk sessions\nRemove people from DataQuest\n\nAdd new people to DataQuest\n\nUpdate Website",

    "text": "Lessons Learned\n\nExplicitly ask about people’s coding experience - this was meant to be for complete beginners, but hard to infer from their description of learning goals.\nWednesdays not great for help desk - too early in the week when there are “due dates” at the end of the week… some learners hadn’t had enough time to work on the lessons by Wednesday.\nHelp Desk walkthough recordings are useful.\nA break week was suggested by a participant, and it was a great idea! We did it in Week 10.\nThis schedule ended up being a bit aggressive, and learners found it difficult to dedicate the time and energy required. This was in part due to the intensity of the schedule, and in large part due to increased stress and workload in their jobs. This was exacerbated by coinciding with field season.\n\n\nDataQuest platform / content\n\nThe platform is pretty good, easy to navigate, saves your progress.\nChandra AI assistant is useful\nSome of the content is a bit dated:\n\ntidyverse - some syntax updates (e.g., .default in case_when(), show_col_types in read_csv)\nUse .Rmd instead of Quarto\nshould we really be teaching rbind and cbind?\n\nNot enough material on actually working in RStudio, using projects, etc. Maybe would be good to insert a “Coding Strategies” talk/lesson?\nAre functions and map() really necessary for an intro course?\nTakes a bit long to get to actually working with and manipulating data with the tidyverse, quite a lot of foundational material at the beginning, which is good in the long run but not very motivating.",
